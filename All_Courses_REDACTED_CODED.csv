Not as part of an equation, but what is it??To me I am thinking stockholders own the assets of a company. Why are assets not stockholders equity and visa versa?Do I need an intro class to the intro class?The instructor also just starts using ""contributed capital"" and ""prior retained earnings"".

6220,1380969645,"Hi [REDACTED]!I am not sure I understood well your question. I will give it a try. (Here we will go a bit off topic.)  Be careful not to mix Accounting with Finance! They both manage the money of the company, but they have different role in the management.  1. Inventory is: ''The raw materials, work-in-process goods and completely finished goods that are considered to be the portion of a business's assets that are ready or will be ready for sale.'' When we sell the goods the inventory becomes an expense. 2. ''Inventory represents one of the most important assets that most businesses possess, because the turnover of inventory represents one of the primary sources of revenue generation and subsequent earnings for the company's shareholders/owners.'' Think what is happening when we hold too much/too little of inventory with the revenue and the earnings. PS. I used the Investopedia for the '' '' , cause I was not 100% sure if I can explain it well with my English. By the way, starting with Accounting classes is a very good idea.Accounting is the language of business, and the heart of business. Accounting is the preparation of accounting records - preparation, analyzing, and the interpretation of financial statements. Finance involves making decisions regarding working capital issues such as level of inventory, cash holding, credit levels, risk management, investment portfolios and etc. For all those decisions finance managers use accounting reports. Let me look in google for better explanation. Here is the one:http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-accounting-and-finance",2

4376,1380243663,"[REDACTED],I have a suggestion for you if you are interesting in taking accounting at a college/university.  Look online,used book sales or go to a library,and get an Accounting book for Accounting 1 and 2 (usually one big book with two parts inside).  It does not really matter if the book is ten years old as debits/credit rules are basically the same as they do not change much.  Try to stay with the course and at least get some terminology about accounting that you take with you when you start college.  I have taken Accounting a long time ago and am just using this course to brush up on my skills/knowledge.  This course moves a little quick and I am already familiar with expenses and payable so I am comfortable but for someone who is just hearing the words they may be a little difficult to grasp if this is your first exposure to such terminology.  Sometimes it helps to have a piece of paper or printout to help guide you and you may find a site on the internet that has such information.  Good luck to you and you are showing such courage going into a college level course before you graduate from high school.",2

5221,1380518169,"I think broadly, the purpose of financial accounting, or the most recent fashionable term is financial reporting, serves one principal purpose: to inform those who have contributed capital to a business the progress of their undertaking. I started my working life as a prospective accountant back in 1983. Over the years, for a variety of reasons and motives, some have overstated and overstretched both the relevance and purpose(s) of financial accounting to commerce. From the standpoint of running a business, without a product or service customers want, you do not have a business. That is simply the harsh reality. As the old saying goes, if you have something other people want, they will beat the path to your door. Apple, the manufacturer of iPad on which I am writing this posting, is a good example.

9429,1383154993,"I think an example might be a machine using a two-stroke internal combustion engine to produce product. Such engines do not have oil pumps. They are lubricated by mixing motor oil into the gasoline. There is a separate motor oil reservoir which must be kept filled. The engine has a carburetor that mixes the oil and gasoline, then injects the mixture into the combustion cylinder. The gasoline is burned to produce work, which clearly makes it a product cost. The oil is not mainly burned to produce work, but is being used to lubricate the engine, a maintenance task. However, the amount of oil used by the engine is directly proportional to the amount of work the engine produces and can be matched to the production. So I would think the motor oil cost, though routine maintenance, would be a product cost rather than a period cost.",2

9436,1383158301,"Watch the videos again; it is mentioned.A company has to carry assets on their books at the lower of either purchase cost, or fair market value. If fair market value goes up the company still has to carry the asset on their books at the purchase cost less accumulated depreciation.When a company is acquired the acquiring company goes through books of the sold company and revalues everything possible to fair market value. Acquired assets carried on the books at purchase cost may be revalued up. This applies to all assets.When KP bought TK they went through TK's books and recalculated a current value for everything that was separable. Then they adjusted the all the values they could on the books, including the inventory. The difference between the aggregate revalued prices for assets and liabilities, and the purchase price, is what we know as goodwill. Goodwill isn't known until the acquired company's assets and liabilities are recalculated and compared to the acquisition price. Companies normally don't buy pre-existing goodwill with an acquisition; they may wind up with it after the acquisition if the purchase price is higher than the aggregate of revalued assets and liabilities.When applying the impairment test in the future goodwill may be determined to have fallen below the historical value, in which case it is written down. My observation from reading financial newspapers for many years is that goodwill is almost always written off sooner rather than later, generally as soon as the company has a good quarter and can write down goodwill but still show net income, and goodwill almost always represents overpayment for the company.",2

It was all I could do to finish one.I am fascinated and inspired by this discussion thread and would like to add another point of view to the reputable real world university vs free online university question...To me, it is a question of feasibility and value. Let's take Harvard Business School as an example. According to their website, tuition costs alone are &gt;$50,000 (US). I won't argue with the marketplace value of a Harvard MBA degree, but a) how many of us could actually gain acceptance into their program? and b) would the marketplace value of the degree have a greater lifetime net benefit (increased income less cost of the degree) than the free version? Since the classes, courses and ideas being shared at Coursera are free, I believe that the benefit to someone like Anon aka [REDACTED] is infinitely greater simply because the lifetime net benefit (increased income less cost of $0) is positive from Day One.You might sense that the whole 'Free Education' idea is exciting to me because it removes the cost factor and makes education available to anyone who truly wants to learn.",2

11032,1385074854,"The treatment makes sense if one focuses on the function of par value and what's going-on in these transactions, in light of that function.  As a general matter, a corporation is not permitted to pay a dividend if, after payment, the net assets of the firm would be less than the aggregate par value of all issued stock.  (There are some refinements that one might make to this statement, but they are too tedious to be the subject of discussion in this forum.)A dividend is a distribution of new shares of stock having the same par value as the old shares.  The par value per share is not changed (and it cannot be changed by a dividend, because the directors declare dividends, whereas changing the par value requires both the directors and the shareholders' approval).  Hence, the aggregate par value of issued stock increases.  Thus, on the financial statements, common stock, representing the aggregate par value of issued stock, needs to be increased.What the prof. is describing as a split is an arrangement in which outstanding shares are reclassified so that the par value per share is decreased in proportion to the split (e.g., par value per share decreases by 50% when there is a 2:1 split).  In such a transaction, the aggregate par value of all issued stock is not changing (the number of shares increases, but its aggregate par value does not).  So, in such a case, the dollar amount on the ""common stock"" line of the balance sheet is not changed (but the par value per share stated on the lead-in to the dollar figures will.",2

Realized Gains are taxed at the end of the reporting period, and represent positive net of all gains/losses during the quarters. And with AFS method it's always clear what the final taxable amount will be, rather then with Trading method we would need to bring up all quarterly Income Statements (or find the original price instead).

10772,1384766775,"Anon:Thanks for the observations.  It would appear we've got the same firm in-mind.  An
 observation I've made previously is that describing something as a 
split does not necessarily inform one as to the impact of the event on 
the par value of the firm (although that does not seem in accord with the convention the Prof. is using in this class).  A split can be effected in Delaware 
(modernly--in the time-frame we're discussing--understanding the issuer in question has now returned from Delaware to the jurisdiction of its roots):a.  by a declaration 
of a dividend (which does not necessarily require a charter 
amendment)--which does not change the par value per share;b. by a reclassification of the stock (which may change the par value per share but need not); orc. in connection with a merger (which may change the par value per share but need not--I'll put aside a consolidation).As I recall, the
 term ""split"" does not actually appear in the pertinent 
Delaware statutory section.By way of illustration, below is a portion of the 
cover page of its 10-K filed 3/77, for fiscal year ended 12/76.  If one were to back-out the par value for the stock at the end 
of 1976 by simply stringing-together the consequences of the splits, one
 would get a par value per share different from the actual as of that 
time:  16-2/3 cents per share.  The cover page was relatively 
easy to get at a modest expense.  Getting the full set of charter 
documents on file, to see precisely what happened in the intervening 
period as to the par value per share (before the move out-of-Delaware) 
is also straight-forward, albeit somewhat more costly (at least through a service), and I'm not entirely sure that Moody's Dividend Record would be sufficiently authoritative in this regard.  But one supposes it will add nothing to the 
understanding--that one cannot simply equate a large split with a 
corresponding change in par value so that the aggregate par value of all
 stock remains the same.  So, I'll elide the additional expense.Regards.",2

10577,1384542848,"Let me see if I can attempt to provide some clarity as to matters raised by your questions.  You write, ""It is the expected profit from the option that is granted.""The Prof. said, ""The fair value estimate tries to take all of that into account.  And there's a lot of sophisticated techniques, that we're not going to talk about to do this. The black-scholes model, the lattice binomial method. But for now just trust me that this fair value is indeed a fair value.""That is, the fair value estimates the value, to the holder, of the option as of the time of the grant.  It's an option.  It may end up being valuable in the sense of allowing the holder to realize money through exercise, because the stock price rises, and it can be exercised profitably.  Or it may not. You write, "" Is it the yearly expected profit or the total profit?""Slide 4/5 for video 9-3 indicates ""Fair value of stock option grant ... This will be amortized over the vesting period."" It is the value of having the right, as of the time of receipt.  It therefore represents the value of possible future pay-offs throughout its life (i.e., it is not ""yearly"").You write, ""Is it the expected profit no matter what year they sell it?""  Well, this valuation is based as of the time of the grant.  Of course, as of that time, no one knows when it will be exercised.  You can look at the end of a text in corporate finance, and get a description and, depending on the text's audience, some detail.  Or, you can take a peek at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes#The_Black.E2.80.93Scholes_equation, which may be adequately persuasive to take the Prof's word that the value will be some reasonably well-developed valuation and then move-on (understanding I'm not in finance, that's my move).As to why it's important:  Since the company is expensing its value over time, it would could be important, particularly if it is a large value--and these can be quite large.That's the best I can do a the moment.  I hope it is informative.",2

Cash (-A) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  400So... how do you interpret the question. Option 1 is to posit that the inventory transaction doesn't show up because the transaction is cash and accounts payable. Option 2: However, the cash contribution to the SCF will decrease during that period (based upon payment of a prior inventory sale) because that transaction debits a $400 liability with cash. Even looking at the income statement which would subtract cash (credit a debit account) and also subtract accounts payable (debit a credit account), when translating this to the SCF you would credit the Accounts Payable account in the SCF ledger to recognize that the cash was deducted from the cash debit account.My guess, although I didn't have that question, would be to pick the second interpretation, i.e. how did it affect the SCF ledger, as it conforms more closely with the 'spirit of the week's lectures'.

5203,1411738068,"Long time-reader, first-time poster here.The discussion about how to account for the euphemistic ""non-revenue sales"" (AKA theft) and the write-down of inventory to fair market value prodded me to think about the accounting treatment for other scenarios where product spoils without making its way to a sale. I'm not sure I have a question here; I'm more summarizing some scenarios to ensure I have the right intuition.Some examples include:1. Raw materials or products that expire prior to sale.2. Zero yield of a manufacturing process...say an entire vat of ketchup is unintentionally purple and thus must be disposed of (because my marketing team wasn't creative enough to call purple a feature and charge a premium for it).Â  Â - I assume in both cases we Dr. COGS &amp; Cr. Inventory for the entire amount to write the assets off.3. Poor yield of a manufacturing process...say I invest the resources to otherwise produce 1000 goods, but 950 are defective, so I have effectively produced 50 very expensive goods for the price of 1000. (Not uncommon in semiconductor manufacturing, for instance.)Â  - I assume this is similar to the above, but instead of an adjustment writing off the entire batch, we write off a portion of it using the same Lower-of-Cost-or-Market method, but the FMV is this time a value greater than zero (as above), but less than the Historical Cost.The net of all these transactions is that there is no affect on LIFO vs FIFO (since I won't have any artificially high-priced inventory, courtesy of the Lower-of-Cost-or-Market) treatment. In short, we take ""the hit"" for the poor yield or expired inventory right in the quarter it is discovered so that quarter's COGS is higher than it would otherwise be and earnings suffer.This begs the question...what controls are typically in place to ensure a company's management doesn't willfully ""fail to discover"" the expired inventory so they can keep earnings up?Is my intuition basically sound on the above?",4

Part of this was what [REDACTED] says- if my business becomes large, most external accountants use QuickBooks so I wanted something that was standard- at least in the US. Also it was only around $US 200 and the interface is very user friendly- you just click buttons such as ""add a vendor/supplier"", pay a vendor, send a customer an invoice- and the software does all the debits and credits and creates new ledger accounts as needed.I know people who are self-employed who used EXCEL to run their business accounting since they were NOT set up as a separate legal entity. In the USA, if you are not concerned with customers suing you and coming after your assets or not concerned with having your company fail and ruin your own credit scores then you can run your business as a self-employed and not be a separate entity.

5904,1412355353,"So, for me, this topic is where Financial Accounting is on a collision course with the 'Real World'. It seems to me that the motivation for each of these transactions 'should be' that the 'company' values (needs) cash more than the value (net present value) the market places on it.Â As I understand it all of these transactions limits the maximum loss of the 'company' to the actual value of the commited Accounts Receivable with the second two being certain loss, i.e. actual sale.So, on the face of it all three are the same after considering cost of collection and reasonableness of collection estimate.Factoring and Securitization in fact are the same from the point of view of the company selling the Accounts Receivable to another entity. The place where it seems to get strange is that the Variable Interest Entity is in fact a subsidiary of the 'company'!!!So my question is whether the company sells its Accounts Receivable to the Variable Interest Entity and receives in return an Accounts Receivable commitment from the Variable Interest Entity considering the VIE couldn't possibly have sold 'shares' in the Accounts Receivable acquired from the 'company' to generate cash until after the VIE actually owned them.Â If this is the case what did the 'company' accomplish considering the structure of the journal entry would probably have taken the form:Dr. Accounts Receivable (+A)Â  Â  Cr. Accounts Receivable (-A)If the VIE partner is in fact a financial institution, such as a bank, that is willing to front the cash to pay the 'company' so the transaction looks like:Dr. Cash (+A)Â  Â  Cr.

3481,1372795993,"Reanimation disease is based on
supposed happenings during the 16 and 1700s via a junk style of
plague that was said to have started in lower Asia, working its way
across Asia to Europe finally settling in Europe starting in the
1600s from the 1200s.


This plague was said once caught to
make a person sick with a malaise style of fever, then into a comma
with death as an end result. The body was then interred. 



With the passage of the few days the
thought of as being dead clawed their way out of their earthen graves
to return to their villages in a stultified but apparently alive
state to be with family members.
When the sun set, these changed family
members bit other family members and this is how said plague invested
in Europe.


The military was assembled and the
numbers of the reanimated were found and extinguished from their half
way between life and death existances. These were not zombies, but
another style of being who is it said had physiologically changed
teeth.


There were also many people that after
being bitten, were able to overcome their sickness by sheer luck or
divine providence. After they had recovered and procreated, it was
said that the children were able to heard these undead from where
they were hiding and with dogs men with torches being armed, were
able to find the last of these plague sorts and dispatch them,


These plague sorts are not known as the
clans.


The estimated then in Europe was on the
guessed order of twenty thousand bitten, maybe a bit more, but with
half of these surviving. Remember this battle goes from the 1600s to
the 1700s as at that time there was no electronic frontier to be able
to communicate data quickly to where the infected might be hiding.


Time had passed and many of these who
had survived but held the gene scar trait, settled in many other
parts of the world. Maybe a lot of them in America. So these
imigrants had children and their children had children and so on.
However the trait of resistance to the reanimation disease was
carried on as a hidden gene trait.


Other saids that a zombie virus that
has the same starter pattern exist in cold vault storage.
It would be estimated that a certain
part of the population would not have this resistance.
Note that now the population of the few
thousands who carry this resistance trait, are probably now in the
modern era, vested in the many millions.


How zombie virus differs from junk
vampire virus, is while the starter trait is the same, with sickness
malaise high fever and death, there is a y function to where either a
vampire is formed, or a zombie is made.


A full viral zombie in theory is a
being that has its basic body and neurological functions intact, but
their higher brain function is arrested and even virally let to
neglect. So the flesh and the body begins to rot, which only the
basal metabolism urges this being to eat subsistence of the flesh, as
this is the only food source that supplies it the raw energy that it
needs.


So to make the math equation stance,
the formula would be, the many decedents of people from the junk
vampire plagues, that are now in differing locations that carry this
past gene scar, which would make them resistant to a viral zombie's
bite, as opposed to people who have no past protection against the
viral zombie bite, as their protection factor is not within their
heritage?


This is the true statistics and the
probable format of this mythical affiliation.


Note I had read an article in FATE
Magazine to where a woman as a child while living on a plantation in
the lower south of the U.S. Was told not to go near an apparent
zombie worker gang based on that plantation. She had been told in no
uncertain terms, that if she became too close to these men because of
their nutrition requirements, that events could take a sudden course
to disaster.


These types of zombies are narcoleptic
by voodoo zombies in order to work off a debt. But I still believe
the telling was accurate.


A narcoleptic Zombie would be much
different than a viral zombie, but it seems that both mythologies are
based in a bit of truth.


There probably would not be a one
hundred percent turn rate with all people turned into viral zombies.

So example x is normally the same as example z. But in some answers above radians (or angles in general) are said to not be real numbers. In my view this could be misleading. A number is a number. When an angle (or anything else) is expressed it is often done so in terms of a number (ie n degrees or m radians where n &amp; m are numbers). Assuming this is the case then we can discuss whether n or m are real numbers. They may not be, They could be imaginary (eg sin(i)). But otherwise they are real. Whether they are integers, rational etc is a different matter. If we had sin(sqrt3) then the number part preceding the implied 'radians' is irrational but it is still real. As an aside when in place of a number we use a variable (eg sin(x)) then often it is necessary to state whether x is real etc. to place limits or 'boundaries' on the possible outcomes.. ",3

Born in Wales, to Norwegian parents, he served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, in which he became a flying ace and intelligence officer, rising to the rank of wing commander. Dahl rose to prominence in the 1940s, with works for both children and adults, and became one of the world's best-selling authors. He has been referred to as ""one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century"". In 2008 The Times placed Dahl 16th on its list of ""The 50 greatest British writers since 1945"". His short stories are known for their unexpected endings, and his children's books for their unsentimental, often very dark humour.

5273,1376172747,"You are correct to think it looks a lot like $$\Delta = E-I$$.  Recall that $$E$$ and $$I$$ are operators that work on sequences.  The operator $$E$$ does a left shift and $$I$$ leaves the sequence alone.  Thus, for example
\[ a = (1,2,1,3,4,5,\ldots)\]
then we have
\[ Ea = (2,1,3,4,5,\ldots)\quad\text{and}\quad Ia = (1,2,1,3,4,5,\ldots).\]
The operator $$\lambda I$$ multiplies each element by $$\lambda$$.  So we would have
\[ 3Ia = (3,6,3,9,12,15,\ldots)\]
and more generally
\[\lambda I a = (\lambda,2\lambda,\lambda,3\lambda,4\lambda,5\lambda,\ldots).\]
The operator $$E-\lambda I$$ thus takes a sequence and subtracts the scaled version from the left shifted version:
\[(E-3I)a = (-1,-5,0,-5,-7,\ldots)\]
and more generally
\[ (E-\lambda I)a = (2-\lambda, 1-2\lambda,3-\lambda,4-3\lambda,5-4\lambda,\ldots).\]Thus $$\Delta$$ is just $$E-\lambda I$$ when $$\lambda =1$$.",2

It just tell us that $$ t $$ is some value between $$ x = - \frac{1}{2} $$ and $$ 0 $$, inclusive. But, with that information, we can calculate the maximum value that $$ e^t $$ can attain.

If we start by assuming that $$a_{n+1}&lt;\frac{a_n}{100}$$ (I'll come back to showing that at the end), then \[\begin{array}{l}a_{N+1}&lt;\frac{a_N}{100}\\a_{N+2}&lt;\frac{a_{N+1}}{100}&lt;\frac{a_N}{100^2}\\a_{N+3}&lt;\frac{a_{N+2}}{100}&lt;\frac{a_{N+1}}{100^2}&lt;\frac{a_N}{100^3}\\\text{etc}\end{array}\]Therefore:\[E_N=\sum_{n=N+1}^\infty a_n &lt; a_N \sum_{n=N+1}^\infty (\frac{1}{100})^{n-N}=a_N \sum_{n=1}^\infty (\frac{1}{100})^n\]But we know that the right side is a geometric series so we know that:\[E_N&lt;a_N \sum_{n=1}^\infty (\frac{1}{100})^n=a_N (\frac{1}{1-{1 \over 100}}-1)=a_N{1 \over 99}\approx a_N {1 \over 100}\]Note that when $$x={1 \over 10}$$, $$a_3 = \frac{1*3*5}{2*4*6} {1 \over 7}({1 \over 10})^7={15 \over 336}10^{-7}&lt;10^{-8}$$.  Therefore: \[E_3&lt;a_3 {1 \over 100}&lt;10^{-8}{1 \over 100}=10^{-10}\]which is the desired accuracy.  Recall that $$a_3$$ is the $$x^7$$ term.Now all that's left is to show that  $$a_{n+1}&lt;\frac{a_n}{100}$$ for $$n\geq3$$.  That's easy to see by taking the ratio of terms:\[\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}= \frac{2n+1}{2n+2}{1 \over 100}\frac{2n+1}{2n+3}\]Evaluating at $$n=3$$ (the $$x^7$$ term), we get\[{a_4 \over a_3}=\frac{7}{8} \frac{7}{9} 10^{-2}={49 \over 72}10^{-2}&lt;10^{-2}\].Note that the ratio is not $$&lt;10^{-3}$$ as asserted in the lecture.",3

2936,1393769093,"Hi [REDACTED],Apologies for the late response! Ã‚Â The statement of Problem 3 provides a differential equation,Ã‚Â $$\frac{dG}{dt} = a - bG - \frac{G}{1+G^2}$$, tells us that this equation can be used to model chemical concentrations in a cell, and asks us to analyze the number of possible equilibria. Ã‚Â The correct answer(s) are that (i) an equilibrium exists for every pair of constants $$a$$ and $$b$$, and (ii) when three equilibria exist, one is stable and two are unstable. Ã‚Â [REDACTED] pointed out that there are some values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ for which the only equilibrium value (i.e., the only constant $$c$$ such that $$G(t) = c$$ solves the differential equation) is negative. Ã‚Â But if the equilibrium value were negative the cell could never reach equilibrium, because it can't have a negative chemical concentration. Ã‚Â For such values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ there are no physical equilibria. Ã‚Â So there are only two ways that (i) and (ii) could be the correct: either the person who wrote the problem meant to write ""every pair of constants $$a$$ and $$b$$ which might appear in nature,"" or they really meant ""equilibrium of the equation"" and not ""equilibrium of the physical system."" Ã‚Â When I wrote ""consider all values of $$a$$ and $$b$$"" above, I just meant to say that the latter is true: the problem writer wanted us to analyze equilibria of the equation. Ã‚Â It turns out that when all you care about is equilibria of the equation, the same analysis applies for all values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ regardless of whether they realistically describe a cell's chemical concentrations in nature, so one can give an answer that is correct for ""all values of $$a$$ and $$b$$'.Best,[REDACTED].",2

3219,1394686960,"hi [REDACTED],This is indeed an interesting question from the physics point of view. However if you do the physics from scratch you cannot ignore the momentum of the mass that is going out of the car (the exhaust) when you are constructing the equations of motion from scratch.Below I will use subscripts ""$$ex$$"" to denote terms related to the exhault, and subscript ""$$car$$"" for those of the car. All velocities denote the X component.It is to be noted that the velocity (relative to ground) of the different part of the exhaust are different: The exhaust is released relative to the car. So when the car is moving slow, the exhaust will have a smaller velocity in +X direction relative to ground. But when the car is moving fast, the velocity of the exhaust relative to ground in +X direction will be higher.Thus, a small chunk of exhaust (say of mass $$d m_{ex}$$) that came out when the car is moving at a velocity $$v_{car}$$ will have a momentum (relative to ground) of $$d p_{ex} = (v_{car} - V_{rel}) d m_{ex}$$ (where $$V_{rel}$$ is the speed in the -X direction at which the exhaust came out relative to the car).Thus, the net momentum of the complete exhaust (all that has ever come out) = $$p_{ex} = \int (v_{car} - V_{rel}) d m_{ex} = \int_0^t (v_{car} - V_{rel}) \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt} dt $$Next, from Newton's second law, on the complete system (that is the car and the complete mass of exhaust),$$F_{fric} = \frac{d}{dt} (p_{ex} + m_{car} v_{car})$$ (where, $$F_{fric}$$
 is the total external force on the car-exhaust system, and mostly is 
comprised of the friction between the wheel and the street).Thus, using the previous integral equation for $$p_{ex}$$ we get,$$F_{fric} = (v_{car} - V_{rel}) \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt} + \frac{d}{dt} (m_{car} v_{car})$$$$ ~~~~~ = (v_{car} - V_{rel}) \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt} +  v_{car} \frac{d m_{car}}{dt} + m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt}$$$$ ~~~~~ = v_{car} \frac{d (m_{ex} + m_{car})}{dt} + m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt} - V_{rel} \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt}$$Now, $$m_{ex} + m_{car}$$ is the total mass of the exhaust-car system, and thus due to conservation of mass, is independent of time: $$\frac{d (m_{ex} + m_{car})}{dt} = 0$$.Thus, $$F_{fric} = m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt} - V_{rel} \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt}$$Finally, we are not given the value of $$V_{rel}$$. But it will be a moderate assumption in case of a car to set $$V_{rel} = 0$$ by assuming that the speed at which the exhaust comes out relative to the car is small (this will be true, for example, if the exhaust is vented out of a vertical chimney as in trucks, thus giving it a zero X-component velocity). [Note however that in vehicles like a jet aeroplane or a rocket this is not true, and in those cases the bulk of the acceleration of the vehicle comes due to the contribution of $$V_{rel}$$].Thus, with that assumption we end up with $$F_{fric} = m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt}$$.And the problem essentially talks about the work done by the external force, $$F_{fric}$$. So $$F = m a$$ works out nicely.This should also explain why, if the car is moving at a constant velocity of $$v_{car} = c$$ on a friction-less road, and is losing mass due to the exhaust, and the $$V_{rel}$$ is small in the X direction, why the car is not expected to accelerate in the X direction all by itself (which is intuitive, but now we have a mathematical argument).Hope this helps.S.",2

1071,1390050190,"Hi [REDACTED],Not to worry, there's an important detail hiding here: $$1/x^2$$ is not differentiable at zero (in fact it's not even defined!  that's why i had to separately specify the value $$f$$ takes at $$0$$ above), so the usual trick of writing $$(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$$ won't work for $$f(x) = e^x$$ and $$g(x) = 1/x^2$$ at $$x=0$$.  To do the calculation you have to go all the way back to the definition and show \[ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{-1/x^2}-0}{x-0} = 0\]To do this, notice\[xe^{1/x^2} = x \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left ( \frac1{x^2} \right)^k \left( \frac 1{k!} \right )= x + \frac 1x + \frac 1{2! x^3} + \frac 1{3!x^5} + \frac 1{4!x^7}+ \cdots \]The first term on the right tends to 0 as $$x \to 0$$ and every other term tends to $$\infty$$ as $$t\to0$$, so $$xe^{-1/x^2} \to \infty$$ as $$t \to 0$$ hence\[\frac{e^{-1/x^2}-0}{x-0} = \frac1{xe^{1/x^2}} \]tends to 0 as $$x \to 0$$, which is what we wanted to show.The function $$f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$$ is famous for its useful properties in calculus and geometry.  You can read more about it (and other functions with interesting Taylor series) in the Approximation and Convergence section of this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series.

Clearly, you were way ahead of me this morning!My family was not really into anything nerdy when I was growing up (probably the opposite, actually). But I read CS Lewis when I was itty bitty, found Frank L. Baum after that, followed by Tolkien shortly thereafter. It was all down hill from there! Asimov and McCaffrey were also on the list of authors I got into in middle school. I was a ravenous bookworm once I was old enough to read (I even went as a bookworm for halloween one year). Before high school I consumed nerdy stuff almost exclusively via books, but added art and television/movies shortly after I got there. And rpg's (no kids for me yet, but I do have several friends who do have them, they're usually around while we game, since we only meet up once every month-ish, though as they grow older we'll probably have to make the games a bit more kid-friendly when they want to join in) after that and into college (where I joined the Science Fiction and Fantasy Guild while I pursued my art degree for graphic design!)Not into supernatural (yet), only caught a couple of episodes here or there and didn't like them much. But that was the same impression I had of Buffy before I sat down and watched it from beginning to end, so I've hardly passed judgement on it. I think we may start watching it later this year, after most of the tv shows we dvr go on break!

That's changed a bit since Apple went Intel -- but older Intel (Windows) computers will still run Paintshop faster than PhotoshopI just checked Adobe's page, and after millions of downloads this past month, they have now  added a dissuasive message that wasn't there last month.  Please note that though they ""strongly advise"" against using outdated software [""PAY for our new stuff instead""], it's legal enough that 100% legitimate commercial software sites are re-distributing it! -- and frankly, given Adobe's long history of security bugs, which were worked out of CS2 over years-log reign as ""the current version"", it may be safer than CS6+. I still prefer to use MS Office 95 (the last version before they introduced macros, which were a major source of security problems for the next decade) on my personal computers, even my work has given me all the later Office versions (""assure compatibility with our current version""). I've always been a techie-type but I honestly never miss any of the ""new"" features (only  professional Office users even *know* about 90% of the new features since Office95) I much prefer the interface (from the days when MS was still working on increasing usability rather than justifying a new edition for a fresh revenue stream) and I'm safer.",2

I was surprised how much was borrowed by marketers for design (concepts like brainstorming) and how little is borrowed by active designers. Even some HR professionals have now started coming up with tangible quantification methods for evaluating intangibles like creativity. For one, I have tried Johari window concept, that makes me get a grip on presentations. Or maybe there are some of you who have been practicing management principles to design.

4955,1370320722,"Thank you all for your input. Each sentence means a lot to me. I'm listening/mulling, and I hope to hear more. For
the rest of the course, I'm going to proceed as if I'm really going through
with this product (I bet my evaluators will just  LOVE my departures
from the rubric), and we'll see where I stand in three weeks. That can
be a lot of time, sometimes.Progress report:
I just got back from a scouting run to IKEA (I'd never been) for other
base candidates.  Having seen the scope of the place, I'm less optimistic
about getting any sort of discount on an order of 100 lamps. The night
manager said it seemed likely, but I think he was just being polite, as
IKEA staff seem to be.

I may have missed the boat on the webcam I'd hoped to use. Best Buy discontinued
it (in favor of a new 2Mpxl model that is slightly less desirable in my
mind, but is widescreen HD (1920x1080) rather than the older 4:3 format
(1600x1200), and their liquidation arm (Cowboom) which was selling them
""refurbished"" (they never admit it's unsold stock) for $8 for a few years, has
apparently sold off all their old stock.

I'm sure other suitable candidates exist (the WEB2C came out in 2008),
but if I can find 100 WEB2Cs for my first model, I'll grab them. I have
emails out to sellers who seem to have stock. 100 isn't such a big order.
It would have been easy to fill 1-2 years ago, but times move fast &amp;
warehouse space isn't free..

I've got some emails out to fabricators, and am working on designs suitable
for prototyping on Ponoko (primarily beause I know their site/materials
the best, and have long wanted to use them) If you haven't read Professor [REDACTED]'s blog, e.g  his article on using Ponoko to fabricate the media shelf or  bike seat he described in lecture,
you probably should -- every tidbit helps, right?

Sadly, I can no longer avoid learning a good 3-D design program -- without
specs, I can't get meaningful quotes. I've mastered many other technical
programs in the past, but it's always been a significant time investment.
I can only hope that having a specific project makes it easier to learn.
It usually does.

The cash investment isn't a problem for me, though I've always been frugal
by nature (indeed, that's partly why I have the cash to throw around).
A 4-credit course at any local college, even a community college, that
offers hands-on experience designing, building, managing and selling would
likely set me back at least $2000 after all the fees were included.
A production run of 100 shouldn't cost more than $4000 (less for a partial
kit) and I'll make part or all of it back, even if I don't sell out the
run. So the cost is likely to be less than a course, and the experience
will be unarguably real, not academic.

I just wish it *were* a course, so I could have you all to moan to, when
things get rough!

526,1382723758,"[REDACTED], I think you're conflating design and marketing. I understand your objections against creating unnecessary objects and reinventing the wheel but these IMO are complete opposites of good design. ""It would appear that a main premise for this course is that ""gaps"" -- shortfalls between what we want and what we have -- can be addressed only by designing something new.""This is not true, nor was it stated anywhere in the requirements. Design is as much about small refinement of existing processes / objects as it is about innovation. Every problem is to an extent a UI problem, and your goal is to come up with a solution that you can explore, iterate on, verbalize and present to a larger audience. The purpose of this class, as far as I understand it, is to teach you how to think like a designer. This means engaging and developing your observation skills and critical thinking, and looking at everyday processes as something that can be optimized. An artifact which would result from such optimization is not necessarily a physical object - it may be a program, an improved process, even a better layout for the post-it notes stuck to ones fridge. I think you'll find it easier to identify gaps if you focus on finding problems first before limiting yourself to a particular solution (like the hypothetical gizmos you mentioned). That's why we've been asked to brainstorm and find ten gaps instead of one.",2

I've added my blog post for this week (half of it).If anyone has any time to give me some extra feedback about which prototype to select I'd be very grateful. Thank you. Here's my post: See the original prototypes here.Testing Prototypes for visual communication education resourceTesting was not easy this week. But the feedback that I did get made me realise I have two audiences, not one: people (students) still learning design and those who have gone into the industry but need a reminder or refresher.I'm creating resources to help people (mostly graphic designers) understand visual communication theory and to be able to relate that to their own design practice in order to design more effectively. The people I was testing with this week are all people that I have either taught in the past or lecturing colleagues and so they are all familiar with visual communication but would like a resource that refreshed their memories as and when needed.This audience was divided between the app and the book. Some said that the app would be best for those who have iPads and were app savvy, whereas the book would be the next best thing. Others felt that the book would be best. All liked the idea of ""dipping in"" as and when needed.But I had set out to create resources for learning and teaching that w0uld take learners through, step by step, so that they learnt visual communication and were then able to use it for themselves. Though I tested user needs with this section I was not able to test this week with any of them. For these learners I still feel sure that the interactive PDF would be best as it would meet the user need of not just being text as it would have links to videos, podcasts and other sites. It would be like a very small MOOC in a way. There'd be several different ones for different theories.What to decide? I'm tempted to continue with both the PDF and the app. I'm excited by the app as it is out of my comfort zone.",3

""E"" is too negative in my opinion. ",1
2351,1384403328,"For what it is worth, here is my take on applying design to processes.
 A user can only experience a process or service by interacting with the collection of artifacts that exist to enable the process. So if you are working on a process the techniques are the same but it&#39;s hard because you are probably actually designing many artifacts. This weeks lectures might help as [REDACTED] talks about focused versus comprehensive prototypes. If your gap involves a process maybe you could focus on one particular part of the process and prototype the artifact that enables it. 
Storyboards are a good technique for sketching process concepts and modelling and simulations are a good techniques for testing prototype processes to ensure that all of the individual artifacts interact in an integrated way to deliver good experiences.

""0 if they didn't do it; 1 if they did it but it sucks; 2 if they actually got the 2-point perspective right.""  That's my guess.",2
1368,1383145714,"Everybody has done a great job here.  Congrats!Most of the questions have already been answered, so I'll add only a brief guideline, hoping that it closes any missing gap ;-) - This evaluating exercise is not only about grading your peer's work, but about understanding the design process, dealing with diversity, following guidelines and finding out the best way to  give feedback and support to other people. -  For almost everybody, delivering 1st. week's work is quite a challenge.   Sometimes there are too many new things to deal with.  So, feel very proud of yourself if you did it.  -  In the begginning, remember that specific instructions are guidelines.  This doesn't mean that you don't have to follow them.  It means that, when grading other peer's work (or your work), you are invited to use common sense.  Take a minute and think about the overall purpose of what you've been asked to do.  So, if your peer didn't do exactly as it was told, but you could understand the overall idea, for this week, it is good enough.  - Score correct in line with the intrstuctions and criteria, with the emphasis on the design process (not the size of the images, count of words, order of posts, ink color...).  If you follow the guidelines, you can be sure that you'll get full credit.  -  What is basic?  There has to be a Gap in ""My Gap"" page with it's corresponding text.  There has to be a list of 10 gaps.  There  has to be a chair sketch.  There has to be a sketch + a prototype that fills your Gap.  Everything in between the given instructions and what you actually see in your peer's websites,  is your learning exercise: think about it, try to undertand what happened, what and why went wrong; decide if it is relevant or not, etc, etc. Give feedback, encourage people to see ""the big picture"".  Everytime you evaluate someone else, you are making a statement.  So make sure that your staments are uplifting, that help others improve their work and learning experience.Yes.  We will be working to fill Gaps... and if you do the assignments, you'll come up with  solutions.   This is a safe environment, so take risks!   It is better for you to loose some points (because you tried and failed), than getting full credit (because you played safe) but without learning anything new about yourself.  Enjoy the ride.",1

The title of this course does include the words ""creation of artifacts"" and so it should hardly have come as a surprise that it includes making things. The lecturer does make a point of saying that the current exercise isn't to do with making your fortune or having the world beat a path to your door. The title of the course also includes the words ""in society"" and so there is some emphasis on doing things in a socially responsible way. The best way of learning things is often through doing something yourself. Most people doing the course probably don't have the skills or materials to make a prototype that's anything other than Heath Robinson-ish - I certainly don't.

It provides many more options than designer's first intuitions.It's been a hard work, but once you solve single problems separately, many different concepts come up very easily. You only must choose which needs you want to be solved by each concept and enjoy the process.""Before the course, I just trusted on my intuition to come up with creative ideas. But this technique, even though it could seem very rigid, makes the work so easy and rewarding!. After a conscientious work, by which you solve isolated problems you choose from your User Needs' list, your creativity and a the process itself joins to come up with loads of concepts! Of course you don't need to develop 2 similar concepts that only defers in one subtle feature, because it wouldn't be helpful. Just create, experiment, with the tools you have from the Decomposition process. After that, you may choose the most you like for the assignment.Please, enjoy the process, it's the better advice I can give you.

1447,1383245106,"""Are there examples, where users have created or contributed to create a design artifact? ( It could be service, not just a product)""Coursera website. I took a class where students reported gaps in the organization of course materials. The reports weren't necessarily formal bug reports - they were just questions in the forums indicating a difficulty with some feature, for example ""Help, I don't know how to get to my next peer review."" This is an example where users sense a gap but don't necessarily have the technical language to define the problem (the buttons controlling navigation between peer reviews are not clear enough to the users). Nonetheless, they can contribute to the design by documenting the gap.The staff collected student feedback and suggestions on how to clarify the navigation, how to make course materials easier to find, and how to prevent common mistakes that would result in assignments not being submitted and students losing credit. When the course was offered next time, the layout and navigation were changed to incorporate the feedback - the result was a much improved learning experience.""Also, what makes design for a group of users harder than for yourself?""A much larger list of needs that your design must satisfy. It's entirely possible that your ""I don't care"" need is someone else's ""must have"", and you have to anticipate that in your design. This is a big challenge for me because it's easy to fall into the trap of ""I'm a pretty average user, and therefore my needs are representative of most everyone else's."" This assumption proved inaccurate every time I made it. You may also have to reconcile conflicting feature requests from multiple user groups.

It doesn??t matter if you trade in $ or Shares. You are just buying and selling a product/service that has a currency conversion.True sharing is something like couchsurfing, you do it without expecting any retribution. Also, sharing is an activity that doesn??t occur for pleasure for the receiving part, instead it??s due to a need.When i came to this realization i noticed that i was just gamifying ebay.So in the end we have:- Someone who NEEDS something from the system, and as such doesn??t need motivation because he is already extrinsically motivated.- Someone who wants to make profit from the system, and as such is already extrinsically motivated.If you don??t need anything you simply won??t partake in the activity.

There are 4 multiple-choice quizzes covering the material in the

covered by the written assignments and the final.)  They are generally

Quizzes may be resubmitted prior to the due date and you will receive
 credit for your highest score. However, after the first time you submit
 a quiz, your score on that attempt will be reduced by 20% for each 
subsequent submission.  In other words, you receive the full score for 
submission 1, only 80% of your score for submission 2, 60% for 
submission 3, and so forth.
As explained in the introduction to the quizzes, some of the 
questions have one correct answer (radio buttons). Others, however, ask 
you to check off all of the correct answers from a provided list.  On 
these ""checkbox"" questions, you gain credit for correct answers and lose

we could use; but admittedly

I almost wish the question had been: ""Be as specific as you
can in describing a gamification system..."" I would have at least had a
chance, then, of being on the same page as peer graders who couldn't follow the
directions themselves and then felt I ""didn't give enough specific

For what it's worth, here's my essay-Fifty thousand city employees will find different reasons for motivation in a gamified system to improve health.  Thus, it should necessarily include a broad range of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators to seduce the largest percentage of the employee population to participate.  An investment of several million dollars will ensure success and will save many more tens of millions of dollars through decreased health costs.   A website and iOS and Android apps will be launched with a big media lead up and kick off to start the program.  There are likely many employees who are already intrinsically motivated to exercise and eat healthy.  Many of these are likely to continue or improve their healthy habits with intinsic motivation including the characteristics of competence, autonomy and relatedness.  Points, badges, and leaderboards will be applied in this game of ""City Champs""  City employees will earn badges when they form competitive teams in their preferred sports with other employee-athletes, with a variety of badges to be earned.  They will receive points for each competitive event and bonus points for participating as a ""city team"".  Leaderboards will encourage competition in major sports such as road running and bicycle racing, mountain biking, etc.  Mayor [REDACTED] will recognize leaderboard champs and other consistent achievers with a variety of incentives such as mayor's lunches, newsletter recognition, etc.  At certain levels of achievement, employee-athletes will be eligible for city sponsorship including reimbursement of equpment and travel costs.  Many other employees, perhaps the majority, will benefit from an alternative game: ""Healthy City"".  This game will also include points and badges but will de-emphasize status and not use leaderboards.  Points and badges will be issued for a broad variety of health behaviors and achievements, such as quitting smoking, walking 20 minutes, eating more vegetables, and losing weight.  Additional badges may be earned for forming healthy social groups with bonus points and badges for achievements of the group, e.g. bonus 100 points if everyone in the group loses 5 kilograms.  The initial incentive to participate will leverage the power of defaults- for the first 6 months of Healthy City city employees will receive a weekly bonus of 2 overtime hours each week, but only if they earn one badge per week.  A variety of contingency rewards will be used for additional incentives including points for engagement, completion, and performance.  Reward schedules will also have variety with a mix of certain rewards, e.g. one extra vacation day for earning 50 badges, and uncertain rewards, e.g. $50 in week 10 if you ate 10 different vegetable types in week 9.  Players in this game will receive additional rewards for progression through various stages of healthy living.

Here what I understood this to mean.  
What are shares and for whom?   Shares would be like say coins that you get for arcade game. Or in video games.  Where you spend real money to buy the coins and use the to purchase other things like a ride in the simulator machine or exchange coins in a video game for food.  The shares are used by anyone wanting to share there stuff.
With whom are shares traded? With other people that participate in the Shareall tool.  They are other people that want to share items in particular countries or states near you.  Look at the example sites for zipcar it might help.
Is it between users and people listing their assets? Yes
How does Shareall charge for the assets?  Using the shares as money the person listing tell them the price they want to use the item.  I would think shares means you don&#39;t have to worry about conversion rates for different currency.  That would be done when you buy your shares.

If a particular match was done by several people, both the poster of the rental request and the poster of the rental offer would be contacted with each other's listing, plus players would get points (and potentially Shares). For full disclosure, I was inspired by the MMORPG ""Guild Wars 2"", which did pretty much this, improving traditional MMO's auction house by providing buyers with this proactive solution, and sellers with a quick way to sell their items this way.

Some of the game elements that make this game never boring are:

Assembling the board which is done by chance.  This forces your strategy to be different for each game.
Selecting the starting positions strategically before the game commences.
Choosing whether to take chances: deciding whether to build immediately or hold onto resource cards in the hopes of collecting the additional resources I need before a 7 is rolled.
The secret development cards that can hold victory points, knights,
or actions for advancement and foiling others.  And deciding whether to buy these cards or use my resources to build instead.

8411,1367233788,"The task was about designing the system. Imo you didn't do it.I can share my work to show you how I did it.Let's change our cityMy idea of a gamification system to motivate city employees to loose weight is running an internal loyality program called ""Let's change our city"". Every employee can get points for:Ordering healthy food in cafeteriaParticipating in a sport competition (like marathon/bike race etc.)Visiting a gymRunning/cycling (GPS tracking)Going to work by bikeMonthly wegith check (a lots of points when you loose weigth, some when you keep your weight, none when you gain weigth)Completing health related quests Winning individual (or group) challenges between employees (or departments)Extra points for motivating someone else (doing activities in pairs or groups)According to Mayor [REDACTED]'s office economists city can save a lot of money if it's employees loose weight (US$188 million with 5% fit improvement). Proposed gamification system will use this money as an inderect motivation. I assume that saved money can be used in many different ways (probably Mayor [REDACTED] has a lot of ideas), but I think that we need to do something to keep people motivated and spread the motivation not only among the employees, but also among citizens. To do that city should use saved money to promote healthy life by building sport centers, swimming pools, jogging parks, gyms, organising sport competitions, races etc. As we can see there is plenty possibilities to promote healthy life and people fitness. My gamification system will use points collected while living healthy life as votes for deciding what to spend it on. So employees (at the begining) and ctizens (if this loyality program spreads outside city employment group) will decide what kind of healthy life promotion should be done. Maybe they want a new jogging park, maybe they want a swimming pool or maybe they want something else. They will decide. If city decides to make the program available to all the citizens - they can all decide how their city will change.How this system motivatesExtrinsic motivation:top weight-losers will become a faces of public healthy life campaign (it's also intrinsic in my opinion)monthly challenges: winners will get free acces to the gym/swimming pool for the next monthpower to decide (more points you get the more votes you have) Intrinsic motivation:social factor of gamification - working in pairs/groups to win challenges with different department/group; individual challenges between friends/co-workers; leaderboards (comparing to my friends or closest co-workers)an app which will collect information about completed activities (jogging, working out etc.) and prodive it's users an information how this particular activity influenced user's health; this app can also show how user's health will improve when he reaches target weightmoney saved by the city will go for the good cause (building public pro-health/pro-fit infrastructure)we can send e-mail/SMS messages to the employees with information when his/her friend/co-worker is doing healthy activity (may motivate to do te same)What I liked was...peer 1 ??? Giving employees voting power in deciding how the saved money is spent is good idea.peer 2 ??? you're the 3rd student I rate for now and it's my absolute favorite, you considered all the important points, added nice, bold words, so it's easy to read and you didn't forget anything!peer 3 ??? it sounded like fun!!!peer 4 ???

613,1364852204,"For me, the game that was most memorable for me was Tales of Symphonia. It was the first RPG game I'd ever played in my life (before then, the games I usually played were action, puzzle and platformers, and though I'd played Pokemon before ToS I didn't understand or acknowledge that Pokemon was also an RPG) and what made it different than ALL the games I'd played from the age of 4 until the age of 13 when I initially played that game--was the depth of which the story affected me. Symphonia was the first game that knocked my perception of games. Before it, games were a fun activity that I'd do alone when bored or play with my brother when I wanted sibling companionship. But when I played that game--expecting it to be like any other game I'd played--and was hit upside the head with the realization that woah, games could do this to people? Games could make you think? Affect you on such a deep and personal level that they can change your world perceptions of yourself and other people? For me, that was mindblowing at the time. And it was also the defining contributing factor to me wanting to be a game designer, because I want to make games like it someday.Since it's part of a series, other games in the series also have a similar effect. Every game focuses on some major issue or defining concept and creates a story and game around it and I find that I learn many interesting things from every installment, but Tales of Symphonia was my first Tales game and because of its level of impact it'll always be the most special game for me.So, I guess, to answer the question of what makes a game memorable, it would be the story--or whatever part of the game creates an emotional impact on the player to such a degree that they can still remember it for years and years after initially playing it. Back then, at that age, I was struggling with a lot of personal issues and suicidal ideations because I'd spent a large part of my life feeling like my life was insignificant and that I had no value to anyone and things along those lines--and I'll never forget the feeling I had when in the context of the story the main character, Lloyd, told various other characters at varying times that their (my) lives DID have meaning, that you DO have purpose, that no life exists for the sole purpose of dying and that it wasn't me who was wrong but the people who'd made me think like this. That it was nothing that I did or said that made them do the things they did to me, it was because their hearts were weak. Before then, I'd never heard anyone say those things, and because of the nature of playing a game, it felt like he was talking directly to me. That, in my opinion, is how games can be powerful while at the same time being engaging and fun.Ah...I tried to keep this short but I ended up rambling fvhjfvbfd.

People deserve this honest feedback. Sugarcoating doesn't help. Also the more assignments get evaluated the more outliers get mitigated.

Of course, the harder the price was to get, the harder they had to study.But is that enough for someone to be motivated? I feel the need of something that is not only the reward, but actually that making the process more accesible and fun for everyone. Se we know that rewards are usually a good way to motivate, but what could we do to make the learning process more enjoyable and satisfactory?",2.0

5640,1392757126,"Someone on another thread recommended the language learning site busuu.com a few weeks ago. I gave it a try and didn't enjoy it at all. First off was the cookie-cutter problem. I used to use Livemocha a few years ago and this was very similar. I'd spent a lot of time on that site helping people with their English and had worked my way up to some kind of gold star level, which didn't turn out to mean much. I eventually gave it up because of the huge time and effort it took, and now busuu was asking me to do the same thing all over. It just seemed like a lot of work and not a lot of fun.For the lessons I tried, I was being rewarded with berries for doing things correctly--even very simple things, even things that I was just guessing at. It just didn't seem at all meaningful.And as for the social aspect of friending strangers who speak my target language to get my assignments marked, I just really don't like friending strangers. It didn't appeal to me with LiveMocha, and it still doesn't appeal at busuu.On the other hand, I've been using Duolingo for a few months now and am quite enjoying that. The social demands are way less. I can comment on some translation or help people or not as I choose, but I don't have to spend time on that if I don't want to. Basically it is just less like work but with enough gamelike feedback to make me want to learn new material and review the old.

This is very nice topic he mentioned. I hope to contribute something meaningful to you all.
Old: I used to play Knight Online, Prince of Persia 1-2-3 (favoritely 2&gt;1&gt;3 - i don&#39;t want to mention 4,5 which were totally disappoint for me), Green Army and Fifa 2005. Knight online was for group play with my friends, Prince of Persia ... with its narrative and puzzles I loved it, Army Men... with its legendary Sarge and colorful soldiers and environment took me whole-heartedly to its joy. I played Fifa 2005 mostly to spend time with friends, now i hate Football.
New: Over the more than haf decade the new full-blown games like Assasins&#39;s Creed, Call of Duty, Crysis, Far Cry, Dishonored have been totally AMAZING. I developed a new attitude towards a game in which to be stealth as much as possible. Dishonored for example Dishonored is my favourite because you don&#39;t have to kill EVERYONE, Far Cry with its story taking a one big gap, but the gameplay very enthusically remarkable. Call of Duty series, exceptionally some of them (you know what i mean) were a great research to me. Each time I developed a idea of purpose from episodes and tactics to develop simultaneously. Ohh last but not least Assasins&#39;s Creed -- from Altair, to Ezio, to Connor, to Edward.. Those conspiracies and battles taught a lot to me about Rome History and the stealthy feeling never stopped with its vivid features. 
I love games, and my path(teaching) taking a shape and I want to learn from it.

Gamification can be used here and the ideas are very good.You should also use the fidelty card here, as it is already in use: If you buy something online instead of offline you get rewarded twice as many points for example. Perhaps also bonus points for registering, first purchase online, buying many different products (""You already tried out 5% of our product range"") or other tasks as mentioned above.You could also add rewards for buying a lot of vegetables or getting all the ingredients for a certain meal, so you can earn badges and bonus points for cooking healthy/traditional/etc. meals. This can also be a way of getting people to come back ""I want to know which new recipe is posted today/this week.""There should also be a reward for registering until a certain date, so many people join in a short time and the social aspect can be used from the beginning. Like showing what you bought to your friends or sharing recipes with friends and making it easy to put the required ingredients on their shopping list...You should not use tasks, that stop the people from buying or doing certain things like ""badge for not buying unhealthy food"" or ""bonus for shopping only online and not offline"", because then the people would just go to a different store for these things.Ok, just some brainstorming, but perhaps it helps",2

It's true that rubrics are not such a widely-known grading device, but these ones seem to me quite transparent and easy to apply. ??Of course, then there's still the matter of comments/suggestions: there's little or no incentive to provide them, so lots of people just skip them.

For me, it's primarily a means to interact socially with people in a way other than having an engaged conversation with them. (When stuck at the cottage, it's somewhere between reading a book (cutting myself off from people around me) and a committed-to conversation or debate (complete social engagement).Yahtzee offers social fun, for sure. But I'm not sure if it qualifies as 'easy fun' or 'hard fun'. It's a little complicated the first time, but if you think of it as 'poker with scaffolding' it offers relatively easy fun for adults, slightly harder fun for kids, and everyone can move to a higher level of mastery over time. Your choices are limited and nicely categorized, but choices made earlier in the game start to constrain your options towards the end of the game. There are surprises, but if you start to appreciate the probability of certain roles, you can make wise bets that pay off over time.It's also a good example of balance - all those combos mean that you'll often role 'something' each time - but allows for lucky streaks to pull ahead unexpectedly, or get you out of looming disaster.

Moreover, in game studies, this distinction between games and play is usually tied back to Callois' concept of paidia and ludus as two poles of play activities.

I think it could be fine short term for a startup as long as the habits that were being formed were the right habits and don't rely on the game elements.I can empathise with her stand point, though. I am a website developer and I see many advertisments for web hosting companies that offer easy to build websites. I have looked at the end results of these web-builders and quite often cringe at what s being produced. I would say that a badly implemented game system could be similar.I don't feel threatened or concerned by these web-builders as I see the benefit I can gain from them. When the people that are using them realise the end result is not working, they will start looking for professional help to build a website that works.Applying Gamification badly, however is different. If a website is bad it is the business that is effected as the customers won't be directed through to the sales channels properly, it is acting like a locked door to a shop, customers just won't come. If they do come back and things are fixed then there is no real long term damage. Bad gamification could be worse than the locked door, however, it could be more like a member of the sales team telling everyone to F off and shop somewhere else. Even if it is fixed, customers might not come back because they have been driven away from the business by the poor experience.I do think gamifying motivation is powerful and that is why I think it needs to be taken very seriously and implemented properly.",2

I thought if I had to spend time looking for hidden messages within the lecture videos I would miss some of the content being presented...so I decided not to look.I wonder if anyone else thought the same way?Until this course I had never played Plants v Zombies ... now I have become addicted to it.I think it was introduced to show us the concepts of onboarding and scaffolding but I kept playing it as I moved throough the course and was pleased to identify more and more game elements and structures it uses as my knowledge about the subject increased.I discovered that I am absolutely useless at folding proteins, so when it comes to solving puzzles for science I am not much use. I might give this another go when I have some spare time...perhaps.I enjoyed interacting with people on the discussion forums...although I think some people, perhaps, could have done a little more to find the fun in this course. Does it really matter so desperately if your peers graded you two marks rather than three in an assignment?And I have now completed a course which I will find useful in my job - I do work for a company which uses gamification in its business so this course was really helpful.Finally this was my first introduction to the concept of a Massive Open Online Course...and I don't think I could have had a better introduction.Ok time for me to go, I have either got some zombies to kill or some proteins to fold...one or the other.And if you still have the final exam to complete...good luck.[REDACTED].",3

4323,1392065209,"[REDACTED], parents have always ""gamified"" the kids chores and behaviour, I think. How many of us had a little chart where you drew a happy face or sad face depending on whether you made your bed and ate your veggies that day? ;) I did and it actually worked to make me and my brother behave better. I wouldn't call it manipulation, I think we've gotten so scared of that word that every action that's intended to change someone's behaviour is seen as somehow suspect and shady now. And it shouldn't be, because influencing (a much better word, I think) other people to do things is a perfectly normal and necessary part of everyday life, unless you're a hermit. Especially when we are talking about people with little to no impulse control and sense of self-preservation, also known as little kids. ;)And about gamifying work - I think it can be ethically problematic only when you try to sneak it in unnoticed, like it's something shameful that should be avoided, probably hiding the real value of the work people are doing to justify not paying them much money. I've participated in several astronomy programs that asked people around the world to help them analyze the tons of data they had and they were usually gamified to some extent. It felt like a puzzle game and it was definitely fun, and I don't really understand the mindset of someone who'd be okay with doing that only so long as no one said ""by the way, you're doing some very important work right now"". I think the same would apply to actual ""work work"" - if I got a job and they told me ""we want you to search the huge database for errors, but we've designed it to look like a pattern recognition puzzle game so you wouldn't get bored to death after 3 days"" I would definitely not complain about that...",2

7580,1393851532,"I got 10 for this assignment, but I think I was a bit lucky because brand development is my specialty. I hope this helps, and any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.**********This report will show reasons why utilization of gamification can 
enhance competitiveness of Cereals Inc.?â‚¬?s marketing objectives.First
 of all, studies indicate that playing games can alter the participants'
 behaviors to be as intended by the game designers or organizers. This 
concept is called Behavior Change Games,
 and it's been a growing trend recently in training industry. Therefore,
 if we can tap into this concept, we will gain higher opportunity in 
altering the target's behavior to match our business objectives.In terms of business application, several studies
 show that our target audience - Generation X-ers and Y-ers - are 
already well-versed with video games, social media, internet, and 
general information technology. This means that the application of 
gamification to our marketing strategy is not a far-fetched foreign 
concept that needs hefty amount of time for our target to get accustomed
 to. On contrary, as the majority of our target grows up playing video 
games, they have a tendency to implement gaming concept to most aspects their lives - which also includes motivation and decision-making process to buy.Branding-wise,
 gamification can help creating stronger impact on brand recognition as 
gamified advertising campaigns usually stand out better than traditional
 ones. Should the target interacts with our gamified campaign, our brand
 will further benefit from higher brand retention as well.In 
addition to science and reasons above, elements of fun in gamification 
can enliven our marketing strategy to touch the target on emotional 
level. It is commonly known in advertising industry that ideas which 
touch the audience?â‚¬?s heart have stronger persuasiveness than rational 
appeals. By all means, you can't bore customers to buy your product.Conclusively,
 application of gamification can help us achieve many business goals 
including, but not limited to, consumer's behavior alteration, greater 
effectiveness in communication and branding, just to name a couple.",1

1931,1391107414,"There is a good bit of research, both with children and adults, on the impacts of extrinsic versus intrinsic rewards, and in general (especially with children, and especially with my own 9-y-o son) I am against a high focus on extrinsic rewards for kids for doing what they're supposed to do.  There are places where it can be used to add a little levity and humor to something that is tedious, but there are some behaviors that, when there is a focus on extrinsic reward for them, once the rewards are removed, the behavior reduces well below even the starting level.  And so I don't give prizes or rewards for getting good grades -- my son's job *IS* to do his best in school.  But I may use rewards or extrinsic motivators to encourage some household routines (making bed, etc.) to get the behavior started, then slowly taper off the rewards.  I have a similar problem with adults in the workplace.  We want to encourage certain behaviors, but we don't want to accidentally mess up by giving extrinsic rewards that either make it seem like we're wheedling certain people to do their jobs, and we really don't want to find that if we remove the extrinsic rewards, they stop doing those things!  Finding the middle ground -- just enough of the gamified feedback to encourage them to do things that they might consider tedious but are necessary, but not so much that it removes their inherent responsibility to do these elements of their jobs unless ""bribed"" with goodies -- has been a real challenge for me.  I'm hoping it's something that's addressed in the class.  ",2

9576,1395665602,"Hello ^_^YI've been curious about this thread for a while now, and that super detailed post with the graphs and figures up above was extremely informative! Thanks heaps for all your efforts:) ??As for the quote claiming that students learned better in MOOCs when they interacted with others-I completely agree. For me, if I'm not engaging in some meticulous discussion eg like this one, or arguments about motivation, then it's harder to feel connected to everything. This is especially true of online learning I think since you don't technically see your classmates/professors in person. And this might not make sense, but what I really enjoy about MOOCs is the ability to be heard. What I mean by that is sometimes in classrooms, there are more quiet students who don't often voice their opinion. In an online platform like coursera, that divide doesn't really exist anymore. Written communication is very different from verbal communication, and sometimes things you might not be able to phrase out loud just come out better in an affinity space like this. Getting feedback in response to a post feels very rewarding. Analysing/discussing/debating something with other students feels extremely rewarding. Going through an entire course with the same people and reaching the end together, is the biggest reward of them all. That's what it is about participation. I think it's not only the more you participate, the more you learn. But it's also, the more positive you feel-because you made a difference by choosing to be part of a team.Anyway, the stats:) The fact that there is a slight decrease in enrollments from 2012 to 2013 may be due to the simple fact of novelty. I don't know if 2012 was the first year gamification was offered, but I'd imagine that any new MOOC would instantly grab people's attention-curiosity, never heard of xyz before and so on. And from then on, I'd guess the rates of participation would fluctuate from year to year, depending on the popularity of the course/its relevance to other fields like education, business, medicine etc.Great insights!!:D",2

Think like a game designer

Challenges involved in creating a game.

??

There are five relevant words:

?â‚¬?I am a game designer.?â‚¬?

It reminds us that game design is a state of mind.?? If you goal is to have more people
visit your website, or to pick the best employee, or whatever it is, think
about that as a game.?? 

If the participants were playing and if you were designing
what would you do?

However, you do not need to become a game designer to employ
gamification.?? You do not need to
have the skills that the game designer have.?? 

It is also different from thinking like a gamer.?? If you were playing a game, you were probably
not thinking about the structure of the game. 

??

??

Thinking about players.?? 

Whoever it is, you need to say , ?â‚¬?They are my player.?â‚¬?
Instead of customer or consumer.?? 

In game design, the relationship is designer and
player.?? The players are the center
of the game.?? Even though the game
is built by a company the world evolves around the player.?? Players need to feel that they are in
control.?? Players need to feel
autonomy.?? 

??

Something that players care about

Players play.??
Play is a sense of free motion.??
It does not have to have goal.??


Game designers need to 

1)????
Get the players into game

2)????
Make the players continue playing

By its very nature the western democracies have become a playground for lobbyists, industry interests and conspiracies that have absolutely no interest in real democracy. The ""democracy show"" must go on nonetheless. Conveniently, the show consumes the energy of those that might otherwise become dangerous to the status quo. The show provides the necessary excuse when things go wrong and keeps up the illusion of participation.

Article here.
edit: This sentence is, in my opinion, very important;

Presenting the problem to the population as a mutually exclusive choice between an uncertain dangerous freedom and an assured survival under the securing umbrella of the trustworthy state becomes more easy the further the various crises develop. 

Think about how the last 3 problems in your country (i.e. military buying new weapons, introducing a new tax) or in the world (i.e. coup d'etat in Thailand, Syrian army taking over Aleppo) were presented to you. 
Then pick one and spend an hour reading online about it. Don't read the usual scripts. Go to twitter.com/search, find personal blogs of people who are closely related to that problems, search youtube, vimeo, liveleak etc. 
The danger of the 60-year-old bureaucrat will become clearer.

These taxes would prevent the biggest fortunes from continuing to grow disproportionately faster than the economy as a whole.It's worth looking at the work of Wilkinson and Pickett in The Spirit Level also. They discuss how inequality causes poorer outcomes in all kinds of social indicators, from education, to violence and health.

2666,1400370821,"I'm having the feeling that the way in which urbanization is presented in the lectures/readings is a little unbalanced, as if I'm meant to be left with the impression that urbanization is mostly a bad thing. Here, from The new demography aging, migration, and obesity:

The rapid increase in urbanization and in the size of megacities will place stress on food, water, and sanitation systems around the world.

In this very particular regard, for example, it is very well documented that resources are better managed and handled for peoples and cities than in rural areas, since delivery of services and products is more cost effective in cities; and not surprisingly services such as transportation, gas, water, electricity are normally cheaper in cities since you got a whole lot more people in the same place (see Urban or rural: Which is more energy-efficient?).

It is important to keep in mind that urban dwellers have very different lifestyles than rural inhabitants and that cities account for 80 percent of carbon emissions.

Well, this is an unfair comparison because many industries, alongside with people, are located in metropolitan areas; and again, on a per capita basis, you bet a family on a rural area burning logs emits a whole lot more $$CO_2$$ than the same family on an apartment using the central heating of a building (see Electricity Consumption in Rural vs. Urban Areas).
And let alone, that people in cities have better access to education with is also proved to play a key factor in fertility rates.
Cities carry a whole lot of problems, some of which were presented (such as pollution, stress, etc), but unto this particular discussion, I think it's people who put stress on food, water, sanitation... not cities; if anything, cities under proper management offer in fact a relief to this stress until some extend, stress that could otherwise be bigger provided you got the same amount of people on a more spread area, less educated and having more children.

But the alarming aspect is not just the economic implications of the erosion of the middle class, it is also the political ramifications. If the middle class continues to be eroded in the most democratic zones of the world, what will that entail and how will that make the persistence of income inequality ever more acute?

1942,1399871126,"The recent article in ""The Economist"" (26th April 2014) on the subject is very interesting.As per the author, the three major channels through which demography influences the economy are:Size of Workforce, Changes in the rate of productivity growth &amp; ??changes in pattern of savings.I had in my earlier comment in the week 1 discussions talked about the ""Toffee wrapper"" model of transition in the labor force (where the young and old are more in numbers), the associated challenges for organisations.Talking about savings, there is general feeling (to be mapped country wise) that the current younger generation has no faith in savings and would like to live for the day. This is more so in traditional economies where the influence of ""plastic"" (Credit card) are on the increase in tune with the urbanization. ??This leads to the following interesting questions:a) What kind of challenges will organisations, particularly Engineering &amp; manufacturing (more traditional compared to service sector) do you envisage while handling Generation Y &amp; Z workforce.?b) What kind of strategies the banking system should evolve to boost savings (assuming savings is good and need to be encouraged for the economy to grow)?c) Do we continue to deal with ""plastic money"" or are there alternates anticipated?Your views are welcome",3

1828,1399806167,"1. What is the most striking piece of information in lecture 1?As stated in Lecture 1, globalisation makes the world more interrelated than ever before. Regardless of this interconnectedness, there are still many serious issues in all walks of life- economic, social, political, demographic, etc. In my opinion, the most striking piece of information is that globalisation does not remedy our problems, it actually sharps them. For instance, people produce artificially more food than ever, but it is still not fairly allocated even though the highest level of development of logistics and distribution. Moreover, developing countries catch up with developed countries to a certain extent, but inequality within the nations is higher today. Yet another striking example is that we all have access to any kind of information through mass media or the Internet but uncertainty in our reality is deeper. Last but not least, environmental detriment ion is still a topical issue. So, the first lesson is learnt! Thank you for the well-organised Lecture 1. 2. In reading 1, inequality, environment, sustainability, and several other factors are discussed. In your country, which of these seems to be the most popular cause, and why? I am originally from [REDACTED]. Unfortunately, we struggle with all problems discussed in Lecture 1. As far as I am concerned, the most serious issue is social inequality and the huge gap between the poor and the rich. The lack of well-educated middle-class is detrimental for each society and it entails diverse problems- cultural, ethics as well as economic and political.?? ??3. Compared to the United States, the economic standing of many emerging economies is rising. Is this a bad thing? If so, why? There are many pros and cons against the economic rising of the ??merging markets. In my opinion, the war for power was, is still and will be in the future extremely cruel regardless of the participants. The switch of the leading roles is somehow natural. As stated in Lecture 1, we live in G-zero world with no dominant country or bloc of countries. Ceteris paribus, the equilibrium between the super powers leads to development based on greater competition. However, we are witnessing the results of unfair competition every day- the price of the economic rise of the emerging markets is high. They are the greatest pollutants according to the World Health Organisation. Meanwhile, the United States predominant role has lasted too long. Undoubtedly, the United States brought to the world some of the greatest inventions and the American democracy is an outstanding example but the war in Afghanistan will not be forgotten. In conclusion, the controversial 21st century we live in, will continue to amaze and challenge us.",2

Nice posts. We all agree that countries are less prone to disputes than others
states and that hostility between trade block members are less likely to occur
as trade flows raise between them. First Argument is that by increasing contact
among traders and consumers located in various countries, free trade fosters a
sense of international community as well as the development of mutual respect
and harmonious relations that reduce inter- states tensions. Second Argument is
that unfettered commerce dampens political conflict by promoting economic
dependence. Liberal trade encourages specialization in the production of good
and services, rendering private traders and consumers dependent on foreign
markets. These Actors have an incentive to avoid wars with key trading
partners, since any disruption in commercial relations stemming from
hostilities would be costly. Governments, which have reasons to respond to
demands made by constituents and to enhance a country?â‚¬?s economic performance,
face similar incentives. States have political reasons to minimize their
dependence on foreign commerce and that military expansion offers one way to
achieve this end. Hence, as trade flows and the extent of interdependence
increase, so do the incentives for states to take military actions to reduce
their economic vulnerability. Furthermore, as commerce rises, so do the range
of economic issues over which disputes can emerge.
?â‚¬?International hostilities are primarily attributable to variations inn the
distribution of political military capabilities among states.?â‚¬?
?â‚¬?Higher level of trade dampens conflict?â‚¬?.

The intergovernmental panel on climate change in September 2013 raised the probability that global warming is man-made from 90% to 95%. That is very close to consensus from the scientific community. The panel also urged for swift action by governments and industry, saying global warming poses a growing threat to the health, economic rospects and food and water sourcesof billions of people.If there is disagreement, it is coming from conservative politicians and the fossil fuel industry that funds them.

3174,1400845650,"Thank you for this read. This was worth much indeed. There are a few highlights that I'd like to point out from this article that would help the reader to form a more idealistic perspective about the Indian Nation.First of all, India is a hard Nation to govern. much has to do with the vast variety of social, religious and other diversities that are found within the country, including the differentiation of language. Perhaps the only country with a vast variety of languages spoken within its boundaries, India is sub-divided into different states based on language. For the ideal governance, much power is given to these sates, as such to govern a country of such magnitude with respect to language, caste, religion, ethnicity and race is no easy task.Next and perhaps the most weighing of all aspects is the stark contrast between the metropolitan cities which are few in number and the vast majority of the rural areas. There are differences with regard to income disparity, allocation of resources, government policies between the two and so on. It is quite next to impossible to implement policies for growth and development equally in the cities and in the rural areas taking into consideration the sheer size on the and volume of the landmass and population of India.This being said however, the Indian people have voted for a new government during this voting season and a much awaited change from the UPA led congress party that has been piloting the government policies for the last decade. Here we have a fresh government under the leader ship of Mr.Modi who is expected to devote the strength of his office and power to the development and progress of India and its economy. There is definitely going to be a change in the outlook as compared to past decade. This was evident in the stock market boom that India witnessed during the close of the elections.I am not one for speculations, but I am sure that a lot of unexpected event are to unfold during his tenure as PM. To name a few, there is going to be a rise in the FDI for a start. Infrastructure will see a new start and generate much employment. Much of the new policies will focus on reducing the income disparity with the country and fresh bi-lateral talks will be on the table. Just sit back and relax, see a new India unfold.",2
3753,1401554388,"The US Dollar is the reserve currency because people and corporations in other countries want to sell goods and services to the US. Every country and every corporation are free to sell their stuff to sources in any country of their choosing and are free in that contract to choose the currency in which they want to use for that transaction. There is no world authority that requires the the US Dollar be used in these transactions.??So why do people in other countries choose the US Dollar. Well if you want to sell anything to the US, the company in the US that is buying it wants the transaction to be in US dollars so they can compare the price against offers within the US which will be paid in US Dollars. So why would two countries, neither of which are the US want a transaction to be in US dollars. Simply because neither of the companies in those countries want to use the currency from the other country so they agree upon a third party country which turns out to be the US because both companies are already doing business with the US and are used to trading in that currency.So how about China? Well China really wants to sell stuff to the US and is happy to be paid in US dollars so they can go to Africa and buy stuff like minerals and take the US dollars they got from the US and give it to Africa.The US doesn't tell countries to trade in US dollars, they do it because it simplifies their transactions.If China gets around to buying more stuff from the rest of the world than they sell to the US then maybe they will insist on the currency of those transaction being in rinminbi's.??If the Chinese want to sell something to a member of the Euro Zone, the buyer can insist that the transaction must be in Euro's and the Chinese will then calculate the price.

I do believe Education is the solution for the majority of the problems in developing countries; the challenge is, what kind of education is the right one for those countries, right? How many Countries these days produce the professionals they really need? Even developed countries are struggling to produce more scientists, engineers, mathematicians to keep innovating ... etc. In other words and answering your question, I believe a degree from the US could be a pathway to individual success, but it doesn't address the need of a particular Country/Economy/Society and it is not culturally compelling to many of those countries. Those countries need an education system aligned to their needs and realities to really move the needle. Exposure to western political system will certainly help, but again, those countries have their own realities and ways to do business, which not necessarily are perceived locally as negative business practices.

Health and welfare benefit plans may be either defined-benefit or defined-contribution plans as explained in the following:Defined-benefit health and welfare plans??specify a determinable benefit, which may be in the form of reimbursement to the covered plan participant or a direct payment to providers or third party insurers for the cost of specified services. Such plans may also include benefits that are payable as a lump sum, such as death benefits. The level of benefits may be defined or limited based on factors such as age, years of service, and salary. Contributions may be determined by the plan's actuary or be based on actual claims paid, hours worked or other factors determined by the plan sponsor. Even when a plan is funded pursuant to agreements that specify a fixed rate of employer contributions (for example, a collectively bargained multiemployer plan), such a plan may nevertheless be a defined-benefit health and welfare plan if its substance is to provide a defined benefit.Defined-contribution health and welfare plans??maintain an individual account for each plan participant. Such plans have provisions that specify the means of determining the contributions to participants' accounts, rather than the amount of benefits the participants are to receive. The benefits a plan participant will receive are limited to the amount contributed to the participant's account, investment experience, expenses, and any forfeitures allocated to the participant's account. These plans also include flexible spending arrangements.As i understan ""pay as you-go"" is very similar than defined benefit. In some countries of Europe Welfare state covers defined benefit programs with taxes (normally income taxes, you must pay to the govermenet part of your salary).Them all the expenses of the system are covered by taxes as whole.

732,1416325385,"I think that college education is a bit of both -- an aspiration, since one's status is definitely marked by attending a University, and hopefully, college education will lead to increased economic power. The problem is the student debt. College tuition is extremely costly and it rises each year at least by 2%. There are a few ways around this -- for example, by attending community college and then attending a more prestigious university. However, student debt will still exist, so if a college graduate cannot afford to buy a house and remains in debt for several years, that will pose a problem regarding increased economic power. As long as jobs are available after graduating from a university, there is optimism.

At the same time, the difficulty with any model is that it is a simplification of reality. I would love to learn which other models are being used to make sense of worldwide trends. I wonder whether the seemingly comprehensive model introduced this last week, ""the four institutional gearboxes shaping global dynamics in the 21st century"" could be further improves upon, taking into account some of the latest trend(s). For instance shouldn't the exponentially increasing digitalisation of the world (think Internet of Things, Big Data, additive manufacturing) and the impact that new business models have, become a bigger part of the analysis of global trends? Just think of how entire sectors have been changed ""overnight"" such as the travel industry (e.g. Expedia, but also AirBnB), the book and printing industry (e.g. Amazon and Adobe pdf). Now, new developments are rapidly approaching of which the first signals are already there, such as industrial internet by General Electric, where through sensors and big data they get a better grip on the use by their customers and therefore build bigger barriers to entry. The financial sector that is confronted with peer-2-peer lending and crowdsourcing. The educational markets that are confronted by MOOCs and services as Khan Academy.The last years, mass production has been taking place more and more in Asia. This model was mostly based on lower labor costs. Labor costs are increasing in countries as China, while customer demands are more focussed on Just-in-Time delivery, and products need to become more customized. Lead times of months are less-and-less feasible. 3D printing/additive manufacturing will become the way to solve the issue; it will make lead times tremendously short, and may also move manufacturing to where the consumption takes place. As Marc Andreesen has said, any sector is becoming a software sector.These are just some of the trends taking place. It would be nice to see how these factors would still further change wordwide positions, maybe not tomorrow, but maybe already next week, or otherwise certainly in the near years to come.Once again, thank you Prof. [REDACTED]. You did a great job of giving some guidance of making sense of the global trends to come. Let's all contribute to further improve on the model.[REDACTED]??",2

At the beginning of class, I asked all my students why they want to learn English.?? Many of the girls and young women shared that it was their families who encouraged them to study English, that indeed they were there ""for my family.""??

It's just interesting to see how families and family decision making play a huge role, particularly in developing countries, around who goes to school and who gets educated.There is no doubt in my mind, based on my experience in India (however limited), that this trend of emancipation of women and greater education options for women is going to have major implications on population growth, as women who gain education tend to delay bearing children, and that family size is directly impacted by the level of education of the woman -- you could say, the true head of household the world over is the woman!Further evidence can be found in places like Iran where women outnumber men on college campuses.This trend seems to be just beginning in many parts of the developing world, so we can reasonably expect that population growth and family size will continue along the ""low"" to moderately low projection, as discussed in class.-- [REDACTED]??????

842,1416693332,"Dear [REDACTED], I find the question you pose really interesting. I too am becoming increasingly frustrated with the trends in growing inequality in the US. I also am increasingly angry at the role corporate multinationals, also many of which are approaching the point of industry monopolies, and their role in generating increases in income inequality. These are my thoughts in response to your questions... (this is my general train of thought)In terms of economic growth it is viewed as the ideal because I believe what it is considered to imply is that with more money moving around the economy the quality of life for the general population is also thought to increase. I think though this often does not display the whole picture, and as a response that is why many are pushing to not view GDP as the sole indicator for the economic stability of a country. But from a corporate perspective economic growth is viewed as the most important factor. And to be honest, with the current economic model of capitalism, I am not sure if it will be possible to separate the incessant drive of economic growth from the capitalist corporate business model. I believe the goal is always to make more and more money. But we are talking about a system, overall, that has limited resources across the board, and so corners need to be cut somewhere in order to continually maximize profit, and those cuts are being proven to not be made at the executive level, at least not in the US. I have a professor that pointed out to our class that when the economy was going into a tailspin during the most recent recession, in Japan, many corporate executives cut their own pay instead of laying off tens of thousands of employees like what happened here. Which seems to mean it is more a problem in the US than with the corporate capitalist system as a whole. I have yet to understand this dynamic in its entirety, but I truly think it is related to social and cultural norms present in the US, which I think tend to be more cut-throat, individualistic, and self-serving. We tend to be less community minded. I honestly think this is the root of the problem in the US, cultural values. I mean if you think about the foundation of this country it was founded on the notion of individual freedom, innovation, and capitalism. I hope that with women joining the workforce in greater number, and with women holding higher positions we are able to rein in the corporate greed. However, if the statistics shown in this weeks lecture are correct this could very well be. If women are more civic minded, more risk averse, and tend to be more forward thinking this could very well translate to the business sector. I think though the next question is how we can get more and more women to these upper management positions given the number of barriers also mentioned in this lecture. From what I can see, it may be one of the best chances we have to alter this economic system which is proving to benefit an increasingly small few. ",2

transformation (one of many at this time), which is instigated by the financial
struggle its citizens are going through. Friends, relatives and Greeks in
general, have been ?â‚¬?shaping up?â‚¬? as a reaction - I seem to believe- to the instability the country is facing. The
reasoning behind the fitness frenzy or healthy lifestyle is as simple as
""people have nothing else to do that they could afford"" or ""it
is an effective way of decompressing daily stress"". It has nothing to do
with affording to eat much as Julija mentioned about Latvia. ??Another

305,1415427830,"Great question. I like that you're not afraid to call BS on what might not make sense in the lectures.To go back to your original question, I think the three paradoxes (and thank you [REDACTED] for making it easier to understand the adoption dynamics language) are not unique to globalization if you define globalization as the aspects of the modern world which clearly and directly are linked to multiple nation-states - but I think that's part of the challenge with globalization - it's not just a question of ""Japan shipping more products to the US"" or ""people in Africa using Google,"" but there's a higher-level phenomenon that shapes what happens both in globalization and within an individual nation state over the past 20-30 years, and that's really just the fact that things are changing WAY faster than they ever have before in human history.I think that's why these three paradoxes (1 - the system is both highly predictable and highly unpredictable; 2 - everyone copies each other but everyone gets really different results using the same formulas, products, slogans, etc.; and 3 - everyone tries to do the same thing while still trying to be unique or specialize) are just as much paradoxes of the speed of change and the manner in which things are changing.Part of what's driving so much change is that firms, nation-states, consumers, etc. are trying to copy one another based on the various ""drivers"" the professor outlined, but when you import or copy something, you inherently lose part of what you're copying, especially when you're bringing it into a radically different environment - like the US vs. Kenya example above - and in that sense you're changing Kenya to make it more like the US, but you're also making it more obvious how much Kenya is different from the US by importing US institutions, products, etc.I definitely think this also holds true within nation-states - in other words, I agree, yes, these are true not just in globalization - but I don't think that makes them any less valuable for understanding globalization.I agree about the academic jargon and I too had trouble understanding some of that particular slide. ??Part of the challenge with academic jargon is you're talking about things that require very nuanced, sometimes technical thought, and everyday language isn't really designed for this type of sophistication. ??I find jargon pretty frustrating sometimes, but I do have to admit that it's a lot of times even harder describing these concepts without it...??",3

[REDACTED] that or the most part my generation does not see the current massive debt
problem as ours. While the U.S. government debt is a serious problem that can't
be ignored, speaking from experience, my generation is much more concerned with
figuring out our own personal debt before even beginning of thinking of
tackling the national debt. While our parents may have been laid off during
this economic downturn my generation was not laid off because no one would hire
us to begin with. With little (if any) experience companies did not want to
take risks on recent grads so we went back to school being told that more
education would increase our chances of getting hired (and with higher intro salaries).
So we went back to school and got our second degree and once graduation rolled
around we were not able to find jobs because now we were over-qualified. Many
are now working part-time and can barely afford daily life costs (housing,
food, transportation, education debt, insurance, etc.) and could care less
about government debt because of their own poor financial situation. Once our
personal debt is handled (i.e. a large amount of us have full-time decent
paying jobs and are not having to chose if we buy food or put gas in our cars)
I believe that we will look at the national debt as being our own.
While Millennial?â‚¬?s are going to have to address
the U.S. debt issue sooner rather than later (and I believe that the issue is important
to Millennial because they have seen first-hand what personal debt has done to

An economy needs a certain percentage of debt to grow, however when the debt level becomes too high, markets and overall economic health is put at risk. A major concern in Peru, for instances, is the issuance of credit cards to people. Initially, this would seem like a good thing since the commodity boom had tested the main well and pushed up the general income levels of many people to the point where more are qualifying for credit cards.

998,1417314573,"The two major events that seem to have rocked this quarter are 1- the 
falling oil prices and 2- Japan's recession. One would only naturally 
ask if these events are related to each other or if one is a consequence
 of the other. We shall attempt to ascertain just that by looking at 
some related aspects of these events. We shall also attempt to 
understand the potential impact of these scenarios on India and its 
economy.The
 implications for India are many and quite varied at that, but before we
 plunge into the effects on India, lets go over some of the attributes 
that have been responsible for the present state of affairs shall we? in
 particular we shall be looking at Japan's recession, the shale oil 
productions in the US and the woes of the OPEC and GCC in the face of 
diving oil prices.Recession in JapanJapan
 has been in a state of continuous low growth and deflation for quite a 
while now. In 1985 Japan along with five other governments signed the 
'plaza accord' with the US to depreciate the USD in relation with the 
Japanese Yen (JPY); this step backfired almost instantly due to Japan's 
trade restrictions specifically concerning its imports.Japan's 
internal debt rose to a staggering 2+ times that of it's GDP. In April 
2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came about with a policy to increase the 
taxes in an attempt to reduce the government Debt; this may have 
triggered the current recession that has hit Japan. There are many that 
believe this recession will be short lived and that @ 2% levels, the 
inflation will actually stimulate consumption demands.But Japan 
had some weird asset allocations in this matter; the country has 
witnessed near zero interest rate for quite some time now, and ideally, 
established wisdom would suggest that this would foster a rise in 
consumption. But Japan has an ageing workforce and quite the retiree 
population and although the stock market has seen some recovery, it 
hasn't been enough to translate into any actual wealth upshot or 
increased consumption. For over two decades this has been the plight of 
the stock markets and as a result the investor sentiments have been 
indisposed.How
 exactly does this impact India and her economy as of Q4 2014? We shall 
come to that, but before we do, let us examine another important news 
that seem to be rocking the financial world lately.Crude Oil Prices, Shale Oil and the OPECOil,
 the one thing that drives prices and investors all around the world. 
it's an international 'Financial Product' in it's crude form isn't it? 
The prices have dropped to an all time low of less than $83 per barrel ! The
 implications of this are just tremendous and they affect everyone all 
around the world. I know your heads are just spinning at all the 
possibilities that this would open up and indeed it should be. But let's
 also examine how this drop in prices came about to be yeah?It 
had its start somewhere in China's decrease in import of this 
hydrocarbon. Being one of the largest importers of crude, a significant 
drop in consumption levels by this nation could spell disaster for the 
oil revenue dependent countries. Then on top of this already growing 
turbulence, Japan slumps into a recession and the USA which has so far 
been a prominent member among the oil importing countries has shifted 
away to the indigenous shale oil production. As a result Oil prices that
 had been at $100+ a barrel suddenly fell to $80 per barrel.Under
 such circumstances there are only two things that the oil revenue 
dependent governments can possibly do that conventional wisdom would 
suggest. 1- Cut down on production. 2- Reduce the price of Crude oil. 
But as the scenario stands, the OPEC headed by Saudia have decided not 
to cut down on production and instead continue with the current output; 
while leaving the prices to the influence of the market forces of Demand
 and Supply. Now, although this will have a toll on the economy of some 
countries in the Middle East, nations like Saudia are well buffered by 
their cash reserves to survive this slump for sometime. Other countries 
who are not so well buffered have decided to take on economic 
reformation to battle the falling oil prices and reduce their dependence
 on the revenue from the Gulf Oil. (refer to the below for more 
information on the state of affairs in the Middle East)http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/25/us-kuwait-finmin-idUSKCN0IE0AH20141025http://gulfnews.com/business/economy/kuwait-s-emir-says-oil-price-fall-shows-need-to-diversify-economy-1.1405119The
 newly discovered shale oil reserves in the US and it's production 
within the US soil has led to a drop in demand for the Arabian oil. The 
US had long been one of the biggest importer of crude. This drop in 
imports combined with the impact from China and Japan have caused quite a
 bit of turbulence within the GCC and the OPEC countries. 'Brent Crude' 
fell to $80 a barrel. Current trends however indicate that the Middle 
East hopes to combat the US shale oil production with sustained low 
prices. This is a contrasting irony in itself, as the fear of one would 
stop the other from breaking boundaries. Shale oil is expensive to 
produce and the identified reserves are not large enough to justify low 
cost production. Therefore the approach of the OPEC at keeping the 
prices of Oil at $80/barrel range seems to be doing the trick for now. 
As the very idea of expanding shale oil production will keep the crude 
oil prices in check and the very idea of sustained low prices in the 
crude market is enough to put off expanding on the shale oil reserves. 
For countries like Iran and Russia, this $80 per barrel is very bad 
business indeed. They would require a sustained price of $110 per barrel
 to balance out their Balance of Payments; but this is of course good 
news for India.Impact on the Indian EconomySo
 finally we reach the cherry to the pudding, India is in a unique 
position to reap the benefits of this unprecedented economic turmoil, at
 least while it lasts. Japan's recession means a devaluation of the JPY;
 now although it means that India will be in no position to receive the 
$35Mm FDI inflow that PM Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe had agreed to, it does not 
mean that we are at the loosing end.The devalued JPY will mean 
that it is an attractive means for Investors to buy foreign assets and 
risky ones at that, in other countries. India in this regard hold the 
unique advantage in the Asian markets. With China and Japan out of the 
picture and the rest of the prospective nations weakening amid inflation
 or turmoil; making India the ideal market to invest in. The market is 
large enough to absorb the capital inflow that will come in and 
receptive of the FDI inflow as well. Although the debt market in India 
has been attractive in terms of return, it still has a long way to go 
before the average middle class can begin to invest in it. For now the 
sentiments run high on savings deposits and low risk investments 
including insurance products. This is also one of the reason why the 
economy has remained quite strong and shielded from the impact of the 
market turmoil that has gripped most of the other Asian markets.Although
 it has its own faults and demerits, from an investor standpoint, the 
inflation is comparatively low and the common household savings are 
still equity averse. But 2015 could just prove to be the best year for 
India; if you get what I mean.The trends in the Oil production 
seem to favor India as well. Low cost of crude oil means a decrease in 
the price of Petrol and Diesel. Saudia has every plan to regain the 
Asian markets by offering attractive incentives; low prices will also 
see a rise in China's import of oil that had diminished (which was the 
very reason for the start of this cycle) India being in the middle just 
has a comparative advantage without even having asked for it. This also 
seems to comply with Saudi Arabia's decision to leave the price of oil 
to the forces of demand and supply. Increase in consumption will 
eventually see a rise in the oil prices and the prices will stabilize at
 a higher margin than it is now. In the mean while India can squeeze out
 the best of this opportunity with proper planning and execution.The
 ambitions plan to propel investment to 40% of GDP just seems more 
feasible now. As far as India is concerned this seems to be a blessing 
in disguise; but of course this does not come without its own risks. The
 scenario could turn upside down any moment. Indian economists are now 
closely monitoring the scenario and contemplating all possible 
situations. But as i would like to believe, 2015 seems very bright for 
the India's economy.",2

I disagree with you when you say that Word bank serves as banker of central bank. what ever the central bank you consider (FED, European Central Bank, etc...), their roles is very different of the role of Word Bank. 
World Bank provides loans at preferential rates to member countries in difficulty. In return, it demands that policies (called ""structural adjustment policies"") are taken, for example, limit corruption, maintain a balanced budget or facilitate the emergence of a democracy. In addition to loans, it also finance (directly or indirectly) of NGO projects, and conducted extensive research related to the development of each country. This is the role that the Asian bank wants to play but may be on a regional scale.
The Central Bank is a state agency or parastatal. This organization is a public authority, or it is mandated by the state. Its mission is to manage the money monopoly of the state. it acts as lender of last resort to the second-tier banks. it does not lend to the World Bank.

Even during WW2 some American companies maintained ties with their subsidiaries in Germany. It is more evident now in Ukraine. Quite a few EU countries, specially Germany and France continue doing business with Putin and are unwilling to take any serious steps that could prevent him from backing the anti-government rebel forces in the east of Ukraine.

230,1415299831,"Great topic, [REDACTED]!?? Looking ahead, in my opinion, means looking at the past and seeing what may change in the future.It seems to me the two biggest factors influencing globalization are transportation and communications.?? In some sense, globalization has existed for 100s of years - see Marco Polo and the Silk Road, the Roman and British Empires as only a few examples.?? However, before the advent of cheap energy (coal, then oil, then natural gas) and the machines that arose from it, transportation was primitive and distances long.?? Transportation and communication from, say, India to England was measured in months, not hours and nanoseconds as they are today.?? Globalization must have been a cumbersome beast back in the day, and very expensive, so there wasn't much of it.If you accept the premise that transportation and communication are the two biggest drivers of globalization (and you're certainly free to disagree with me), then it may follow that disruption of one of those drivers would act against globalization and shift relationships to regional rather than global axis's.?? And likely as a consequence increase global tensions.So, based on those premises, one might guess that the growing cost of energy might shift trade and relationships to a regional rather than a global level.?? If it simply costs too much to move people and products from one place to another, the distances have to shorten and production becomes localized.Oil prices (Brent crude) have risen globally from $10-15/barrel in 1999 to about $80-85/barrel today and have been mostly over $100 the past few years.?? That energy cost is embedded in literally everything in our lives today, from our cars to cell phones to clothes to food (especially food!).?? And demand for energy is ever increasing.So, in my opinion, if globalization breaks down, it will happen from energy scarcity and competition.?? As two of many current sources of energy tension, see Europe versus Russia over Ukraine and China's incursions in the South China Sea.",2

640,1416095958,"Both of you make very good points. [REDACTED], I agree that the British Empire had a profound impact on the world as we currently know it. Your proposition is not at all dumb. At present it still has an enormous influence even as its political power wanes dramatically. However, I agree with Anonymous that prior empires had extraordinary impact as well, both in the world in those eras and subsequently.Each empire has forged links and left influences far beyond the source 'nation'. When each fell many institutions, artifacts and recorded bodies of knowledge were sidelined, destroyed, thrown in disarray etc but vestiges and/or documentation lay in wait for later re-examination. One example is the gathering of world knowledge in the Alexandrian library, I believe later largely destroyed by Christian 'crusaders' (not one of Christianity's better moments); however, usually some documents are smuggled to safe havens or fortuitously survive these events. The influence of Christianity spread via the Roman Empire after Constantine, all the way west to the British Isles, and in various permutations remained since. Its principles under-gird the current Westminster system (possibly one of Christianity's better moments). Also the European Renaissance drew upon classical influences of the Greek (consider Plato, Socrates, Aristotle...)??and Roman Empires, both of which also laid foundations for democracy and the architecture of state although with differences. Then there is the body of knowledge known as Mathematics which has incrementally developed over millenia, having drawn upon the brilliance of minds nurtured in the Ottoman, Greek, Roman Empires and subsequently European Renaissance thinkers and beyond.??In the mid-late 1800s, European artists and thinkers began to look to 'exotic' cultures (beyond Europe via colonies) for a fresh vision. It was still European-centric and often quite condescending. However, from the mid twentieth century there has been an increasing East-West meeting of minds philosophically and politically/economically. Some may say the West is still arrogantly imperial in significant institutional ways.??This account is all very Middle East/European centered: an indication of how deeply rooted I am in my British-European roots as an older Australian whose parents and grandparents talked of ""the mother country"" and gave me fiction books to read set in England and Europe, so that my own landscape was a foreign land to me until I finally read books set in Australian landscape.A final clue to the colonial impact of the British Empire - in partial support of Brian's assertion - is that the English language has now largely eclipsed French as the International language. Even if the West 'falls' or is superseded, it is highly likely that the language will remain ??as a global communication conduit??for a very long time as Latin did (finally removed from Catholic services mid last century, still remains in international scientific and British legal language).??Cheers,[REDACTED]",2

754,1416390937,"Immigration to the United States is such a touchy issue because the average, uninformed American doesn't want to come to terms with the fact that this is a country that has historically been a refuge for people suffering injustices or substandard quality of life in their home countries. Yet we've continually made the immigration process more and more tedious and regulated, thanks in no small part to the expansion of paternalistic welfare assistance programs politicians have put in place to secure the votes of the poor and minorities. The hypocrisy of it all is that the US government (not its people) bear a great deal of the responsibility for the terrible conditions in these immigrant's home countries, particularly those coming from Latin America and the Middle East. How often did the US send troops to places like Guatemala, Iran, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic to prop up authoritarian regimes that did nothing but stuff their pockets with their nation's wealth and leave their people to starve or worse? And now that the Cold War is over you still have the US participating actively and covertly in places like Mexico, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, creating the incentives in these countries to emigrate but shutting their own doors! A great start to solving this dilemma is ending interventionist US military policy around the world and implementing an immigration strategy like the one proposed by UChicago economist Gary Becker in which work permits and entry visas are treated as market goods. The current quota system in place grossly underrepresents the demand for entry into the Untied States and creates the incentive for people to enter illegally and thus facilitate other criminal behavior like the smuggling of contraband. An immigration solution like Becker's would reduce the number of people resorting to illegal means to enter the country and would free up US Border security to screen for criminals and other nefarious people trying to enter.",2

For me, the worst is the ""maintenance"" fees that some countries charge. So, if you work during 3 years in a country then you move to other, and you only retire in 30 years.

Somalis are migrating to the capital Nairobi were there is already a part of the city called Eastleigh predominantly inbabited by Somali migrants or Kenyans with Somali origin.

There are increasing tenstions between Kenyans and Somalis in Nairobi. Kenyans don't like their expansion in Nairobi and also the threat of terrorist attacts by Al-Shabab (there were already many of them in Nairobi - most medialized was the Westgate shopping mall shooting).

1159,1418186787,"Would like to shift the discussion somewhat to something
that has been bothering me about global warming and its underlying cause.?? I see a lack of intellectual/academic and
even personal integrity on both side of the divide on the global warming
debate.?? The questions, also briefly discussed
by [REDACTED], is whether there is a long term global warming trend that
trumps the effect of man created emissions.??


In 1660 the Glacier Bay glacier in Alaska was in a valley substantially
back from the hedge of the sea, by 1750 the little ice age had thrust the
glacier forward?? covering the entire ??land and further jutted the glacier into the
sea, in 45 years it retreated five miles (even though world population was still
relatively small), by 1880 it retreated 40 more miles, eliminating in the
process the original valley now covered by water, and today one needs to go up
65 miles up the bay to view the tidewater glaciers. 

The question is: if there were no humans on this planet,
would global warming still happen.?? One
does not hear much about this critical questions from scientists, likely
because the answer is enmeshed in politics or political correctness and there
is money to be made by sticking to 'men is the cause'.?? (I believe many scientists must be aware of
the secular trend but are preferring to keep quiet).?? 

The response to the question is critical because
it impacts the solution that is required to address the problem.?? If?? it
is a long term trend, then let's start migrating people from low lying areas,
build seawalls around major cities near oceans- as in New Orleans, basically
have a long term plan to address the inevitable.?? If caused by man, it may be worthwhile to
remove man from the earth (just kidding).??
My belief is that we are in a long term trend, with the speed of the
warming accelerated by man-made emissions.??
Thus there would
still be a need to address the emissions into the atmosphere to at least not accelerate the trend further.?? ",2
420,1415701294,"Since much of this week's discussion centred around the issue of obesity it led me to consider the merits and pitfalls of markets, as well as governments, response to this global epidemic.??Whilst it is essential to keep ""what is"" in the forefront of our minds when it comes to addressing significant trends in economics and society, to what extent do we accept the majority of people with self-debilitating conditions and alter social, political, and economic norms accordingly as opposed to using the Nudge Theory proposed by behavioural economics to slowly change direction?Sure, there are benefits to individual companies and entrepreneurs, especially in food, clothing and medical-related industries by capitalising on the obesity epidemic and all of the ensuing health and psychological problems it presents, but is it the right thing for societies in do???Would it not be a wiser course of action to, in the short term, provide what is needed to make life a bit easier for the obese, but long-term shouldn't the focus be on engaging in business and cultural avenues encouraging those in this unfortunate state to get the education and resources needed to overcome their weight and health issues? Entrepreneurs could make just as much money providing goods and services to promote health rather than disease.I am not in favour of making an ailing population the norm. I have several members of my family and close friends who suffer terribly with issues relating to either obesity, smoking, alcohol, or drugs (legal and illegal) and unfortunately this has caused chronic illness and even death amongst some of my loved ones. A similar plight has befallen over 1 billion people worldwide and is growing. Furthermore, this is only factoring in the obese, not the overweight, which I imagine would bring the total of the world's population with an unhealthy weight to well over 50%.??Any thoughts about whether economics and politics should make use of ethics, morality, and public good in setting policy and practises? I am obviously in favour of such measures.",2
113,1415118606,"I have also commented on the paradoxes; and I share [REDACTED]'s view.?? Growing globalization does not make the world more predictable in my view.?? Perhaps instead it creates common ground for global actions, such as the coordinated efforts of the Fed, the ECB, the IMF and other central banks during the 2008 financial crisis (isomorphism of financial institutions and practices).?? The crisis was surprising (unpredictable, I guess, but in hindsight perhaps fully predictable - many smart people warned of the packaging and selling of junk loans to credulous dupes (banks) in the months and years leading up to it).?? However, the response to the crisis was predictable and had the desired calming effect, ie. crisis did not, except in isolated cases, result in a global run on the banks.Whether locally or globally we are still subject to the weaknesses of human nature and the madness of crowds.?? For example, except for the few, most of us still think the stock markets are least risky when prices are high and rising and most risky when they are low and crashing.?? Those weaknesses extend to global behaviors, I think.To me, perhaps the most powerful slide in the first week's presentations was the one showing how much the Great Recession was correlated worldwide compared to past recessions (showing that 90% of nations contracted in harmony, versus 30-40% in past recessions).?? Too bad the chart did not extend back to the Great Depression for comparison.?? It seemed clear to me from that slide that the consequences of globalization and its tight(er?) connections between nations results in a more coordinated global economy ...... during good times and bad.It also highlights the need for at least some supranational institutions and standards to mitigate the inevitable future ""once in a lifetime"" events.?? As example, I can think of the Basel accords to hold banks in all countries to minimum permanent capital ratios (to mitigate against insolvency, panic and contagion) and international accounting standards (boring, I know, but to maintain integrity of financial markets).?? As always, its a trade-off between regulation (a cost to society) and innovation (a benefit).All that said, as humans our destiny seems to be to forever repeat our past mistakes, each generation relearning the lessons of our parents.",2

883,1416836179,"Dear All,Here are my thoughts of the trade bloc policies based on my observation of EU policies.Pros: The trade within the bloc is increasing dramatically. All countries that joined EU witnessed dramatic increase in trade with countries within the bloc (more investments leading to more export as well as import) The next big thing is the structural investments encouraged by EU. The memberships fees are distributed for purposes often ''forgotten'' by the government. By the ''forgetting effect'' I mean the budget cuts that member states do often, which leads to lower investment in infrastructure projects. EU does not have such constraints as predetermined membership fees is distributed as per long-term perspective lasting 6-8 years. The next thing is free flow of labor (which leads also to negative consequences). After joining the EU, many people from Eastern Europe moved west (mainly UK/Netherlands) in search of better paid work. This lead to an increase in average pay in domestic countries (as the unemployment lowered) but also lead to negative budgetary consequences (the pension system fees decreased rapidly). In the immigration countries their economy became more competitive as the immigrants were on lowest-end of wage scale.?? However their unemployment must rose a bit (not much however considering that their citizens were not willing to work for such low salaries as immigrants do). Cons: Some pathological consequences of policies reduced. For instance, the farmers are paid not to produce certain groceriy so that not to lower its price on common market. This makes people also lazy as ''EU-money'' is given for not working! The next thing is that EU-made infrastructure investments-money is often wasted. The roads bild for EU money must meet certain strict requirements?? that are silly, like building very costly noise barriers next to the highway in the rural areas where noone lives. Cost of such barriers can increase the cost of road by more than 30%! In other projects it is often so that when it is close to the end of budgetary financial perspective and there is still plenty of money not used for certain purposes, the money is quickly spend on not-needed, unnecessary projecrts in order not to return the money back to the budget of the EU (which happens in case when resources are not fully utilized).As you can see from the examples that I have given, the mechanisms behind being a member of integrated trade bloc lead often to inefficiencies and non-rational actions that economic superorganisations should prevent rather than encourage.Maybe you can name a few other strange actions existing within trade blocks (maybe not only EU, but from other blocs as well (NAFTA maybe?)).I am looking forward your input!",2

different view about the future of??Globalization and the end of this
economical model. I don??t fully agree with his theory but he points out so many
factors that will change shortly the economical environment in the world. As
change drivers he highlights the beginning of a new paradigm of transport,
energy and communication base on the ?â‚¬?Internet of things?â‚¬?, integrating in it
the ?â‚¬?Internet of energy?â‚¬? (base in a pull of many different renewable and
no-renewable energies), the ?â‚¬?internet of logistics?â‚¬? made by intelligent system
to integrate horizontally the whole logistic process. In this process will play
a big role the 3D printing and the renewable energy and the consolidation of
collaboration economy. All those will suppose to increase tremendously the
efficiency to produce and provide products and services and this will lead an
economy with a marginal cost very close to zero.

It must have withered away as a result of conflicts between schools of thought, evolution of the concepts of groups, communities, societies, nations, religions,cultures, identity, societal and economic norms, boundaries and so on driven by a desire &amp; need to 'protect' interests of groups, communities, societies, nations et el. The second coming of globalization is like history repeating itself. This time round, it's a need to globalize driven by-saturation &amp; stagnation in developed economies, rapid development in developing and emerging economies, liberalization of state policies to promote and / or endorse partial or full free trade, development and availability of multiple channels of access, communication, transportation, logistics and exchange as is manifest in the innovations in telecommunications, travel, internet, processes and the compelling ??'Utility' of these technological innovations to promote interactions amongst cross border communities. Hence globalization is net positive for the human race. However, just as absolute power corrupts absolutely, so with globalization. The crux question is whether the powers that drive globalization and hold resources and network to do so are doing it 'responsibly'. To an extent driving participation in the globalization phenomenon and process is done responsibly, it would reap huge returns for the human race.

All I ever hear about is Somali piracy and the danger it hold to oil tanker or shipping container ships. I can see why piracy is an option for ordinary Somali who feel like they have no voice of their own on what their government does. Seems like there only way to show their voice is to do piracy. Does this legitimize the cause for Somali piracy their waterways? No but they feel like they have no other choice but to piracy as their water get polluted.??,2

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
You essay does a good job of addressing points 1-3 in the rubric. I really like your observation about poetry possibly being more epansive that painting--it's an arguable point, but a good one. You also did a nice job describing the similarities between poetry and paintg.

I'm new to the course and have hurtled through week 1 & 2 over 48 hours, including one essay, so perhaps my brain is fried, but whilst really enjoying the course, I'm finding the reductive nature of the quizzes a little problematic, some it this may just be, I'm not in a find the right answer mode, or indeed even, a read the questions properly mode.  However, I disagree with some of the instances of what is considered to be the 'right' answer.  The example I want to share, relates to the the 'at desk' question in the second week quiz.  I think you can argue, as I would, that her omission of my or a, can be considered as making the desk non-personal, and that doesn't negate that it is also personal.  Both meanings can co-exist within the poem.  She is referring to her own desk, and so it is personal, but by the same token, by describing herself as 'at desk, she is responding to her grandfather's imperative get 'a trade' and so is expressing that she is in a state of being 'at work' , and when she is ""at work"", she is 'at desk', rather that at mill, or factory, or office, and that this generalised impersonal place, such as a factory would be described, is translated into her world as being 'at desk'. Thereby operating as a statement of I am 'at work', my desk is my work, as an answer to the implied criticism from the grandfather to learn a trade.  Both meanings, the personal and the generalised, I would argue provides more resonance, and more layers of meaning and and references the broader context of the traditional world of work, and the language used to describe it.

A close look at nearly every word, but the structure of the essay itself is rather rigid and predictiable. Although the essay has a clear overall purpose, it lacks a life of its own, being too dependent on the poem under consideration. Instead, follow your own train of thought and let the structure of your essay emerge of its own accord rather than adhere to a simple blueprint.

The essay  is more than paraphrasing the poem , and I agree with her/him that poet is in spiritual hangover . It's a very short essay and I think  it leaves some points that can be discuss more.

The essay does not talk anything about the dashes which are frequently used in the Emily's poems


Essay does not talk anything about the stanzaic form of the poem . However its talk about the figurative drukenness of the speaker.


the essay talks about the poets love of nature ,but there are some other points that needed more analysis.


The essay does not talk about the shifting metaphor.


Overall its a good effort and it will help us to know more about the poem .

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Emily Dickenson's poem &ldquo;I taste a liquor never brewed&rdquo; turns the image of being staggeringly drunk to a surprisingly positive, even redemptive, experience. The poem is a ballad, a form which evokes the drinking songs heard in the taverns and inns where one would expect an &ldquo;Inebriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Debauchee&rdquo; to spend time. Dickenson, however, turns the ballad into a lofty exultation in the joy of beauty and nature, with the four stanzas evoking the four seasons. The excess in the poem is not alcoholic debauchery but an overflowing joy that lifts the drunkard up to heaven.
In the first stanza, the immediate mention of alcohol-related terms &ldquo;liquor,&rdquo; &ldquo;brew[ing],&rdquo; &ldquo;Tankards,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vats upon the Rhine&rdquo; evokes images of darkened taverns and swigs of beer. At the same time, the first stanza includes the disconcerting image of &ldquo;Tankards scooped in Pearl,&rdquo; where &ldquo;Pearl&rdquo; evokes refinement, luxury and wealth&mdash;opposite associations from those of the other beery language. Pearl also evokes the 'pearly gates' of the Christian vision of heaven. ED claims in this stanza to be drinking a liquor that is superior to any physical alcohol. What might this &ldquo;liquor never brewed&rdquo; be?
The poet reveals in the second stanza that it is &ldquo;Air&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dew&rdquo; which are rendering her an &ldquo;Inebriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Debauchee.&rdquo; Rather than getting drunk at night in closed quarters, the poet is &ldquo;Reeling &ndash; thro endless summer days&rdquo;: drunk off of the bright blue sky (&ldquo;Molten Blue&rdquo;) and the prodigal abundance of summer. Nature creates in her effects reminiscent of drunkenness: euphoria, dis-inhibition, poor balance (i.e. deviation from society's straight and narrow ideology). The exploration of inebriation in nature continues in the next stanza, where we encounter &ldquo;the drunken Bee&rdquo; being turned out of its foxglove residence, and Butterflies that are swearing off their whiskey. In contrast to the Bee and Butterfly, though, the poet says she &ldquo;shall but drink the more!&rdquo; That is, even if nature rebukes the bees for being drunk on life, and even if butterflies decide to sober up, ED will only &ldquo;drink&rdquo; more, rather than being discouraged. When the summer days turn to autumn drear, the inebriation will continue.
In the last stanza, the poet reveals the end of her drinking, introduced with the word &ldquo;Till.&rdquo; The scene the drinker is waiting, even longing, for, includes Seraphs celebrating and the Saints running eagerly to their windows: distinctly religious imagery that evokes Heaven. The Seraphs with their ""snowy Hats"" (winter) are traditionally considered highest angels, who are &ldquo;associated with light, ardor and purity&rdquo; (Oxford American Dictionary), and the Saints are extraordinarily good and holy followers of God, well-respected and revered&mdash;the opposite of drunkards who are despised. The poet says she will drink until these holy characters run to their windows (how undignified and childlike!), &ldquo;to see the little Tippler&rdquo; (the poem's habitual drinker, presumably Emily). How peculiar to see the Saints running to see a degenerate drunk! But here the Tippler isn't degenerate or immoral, because the &ldquo;liquor&rdquo; isn't a physical alcohol but is the distillation of life, joy, energy itself.
And the little Tippler is &ldquo;Leaning against the &ndash; Sun --&rdquo;! The leaning reveals a drunk who can't hold herself up, thus is leaning, i.e. depending, on someone else&mdash;a picture of spiritual or emotional dependence, neediness. Leaning against someone is also a sign of intimacy with that person. The drunk leans against &ldquo;the &ndash; Sun &ndash;"". The physical Sun is light, heat, source of warmth and energy, the basis for all of life. &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; has religious or spiritual symbolism as well, which is bolstered by its juxtaposition with the Seraphs and Saints. Like the physical Sun, Christ or God is the source of life and light, warmth and joy and abundance, in Christianity, and ED may be punning on Son/Sun here since Christ is considered the Son of God (and the Son of Man) and is often referred to simply as the Son.
It seems, then, that the poet's inebriation brings her into a deeper connection with life, and even into a more intimate and dependent relationship with God, where she leans up against Him while the saints and angels look on and cheer. This meaning is not immediately obvious upon a first reading of the poem, but emerges to a reader who take the time to &ldquo;drink in&rdquo; the implications of each word and image. The poet never directly names the liquor that inebriates her, nor the setting of the final scene. Even the identity of the Sun is veiled. The meaning of the poem is open to one who is also &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; on the air and sky as the poet is, but it is closed to anyone not willing to &ldquo;reel&rdquo; through the &ldquo;endless summer days&rdquo; of nature and of poetry. The inebriation of light and life brings many rewards, from the humble opening of this poem to the sublime opening of Heaven.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
Yes, I think you see the problems in v1 from the imagist manifesto point of view. But I think you might be a little harsh. I mean. . .he decided not to publish it. It is a draft and takes him towards the final. I also think you might want to reconsider your view on ""story."" An image (in fact Imagism) can reveal a scene or image that tells a story or even a fragment of a story. The poem has emotion. It has possibility. And. . . this poem has two characters that interact in a very special way in a special moment. And it's very important for the appreciation of the poem to not neglect it.

Your ""close reading"" of the poem contained much of the same summer-like energy that was contained in the original piece. You seem to have a natural exhuberance for things like flowers and insects and sunshine, and your writing reveals a heart for nature. Your image of ED outside dancing with her arms extended in appreciation of summer's natural beauty is a great observation about the ""story"" of the speaker. I think you are rlght in your assessment that this poem is not just about summer, but something more eternal and spiritual. (heaven, goodness) I really your speculation at the end of  your essay suggesting that the little tippler may indeed be a sunflower. How appropriate.

This particularly essay brought a interpretation really close to a literal meaning to the whole poem. Of course, there's some bold lines of thinking that improve the text, just like:""...the little tippler in her state of wonderful natural intoxication, as the poet leans against the sun like a drunk against a lamp post""; it was a differential to enrich the metaphor understanding. The liquor was interpreted as a special kind ok drink, the poet was identified in some word assets (""I"" and ""the little Tippler"") and the paper does a special reference about the dashes: ""The poem contains numerous dashes and breaks giving it a staggering or drunken feel, like the flights of butterflies and bees, or the gate of someone who has had too much to drink.( It is interesting to note that there are other publications of this poem in books and other media that have smoothed out the appearance of the poem by removing the dashes and replacing some of them with commas.This seems even more remarkable since this is one of the few poems published during Dickenson's lifetime. It would be interesting to see what the actual original manuscript looks like.""  This definitly was a differential. And Emily experience on drinking liquor was compared to her personal thought on nature, a kind of fascination and splendor equal to the liquor debuchee result that justifies the essay's title.  The whole text explored in a compact manner all Emily's intentions on the poem. Wasn't a superficial reading, but was placed in some common notions about this particular Dickinson's work. Even so, it's a good one.

This poem seemed as if it could conform to the New York School by dealing with every day events using plain language. It does not conform because I have imposed meaning. However, it is based on an experience no one would know unless I recorded it. It is an attempt to write ""something that has never been written before.""

FOR MY BROTHER, THE MONK,

WHO WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE THERE

The last time I saw them together, 

our father had a feeding tube. 

At home, our mother made his meals a feast 

as she always did for us.

I saw her pull her wheelchair close to his.

One of her hands lifted a can of Ensure;

the other that life-saving, transparent snake.

She began to pour. They didn't pray or give

any kind of thanks, but she turned to me,

saying, ""This is how we lap dance.""

Remember how deeply blue her eyes were?

A deeper blue in death, her eyes that day

were full of an intimacy we never knew existed

behind their bedroom door.

In response to this assignment's prompt I eliminated all prepositonal phrases as I tend to use them a lot. I was interested in seeing if the poem made sense or was improved. Here is what was left:

The last time I saw them together,

were full we never knew existed.

As I studied the results of the experiment I saw the poem, while awkward in some places, had become pleasantly condensed. It was clear I was trying to present an image. I thought of Williams and the Imagists. Without the prepositional phrases I could see the bones of the poem. How much flesh did I want to put on? Did I even like the former version? I would leave out the prepositional phrases in my next revision. I would also leave out punctuation but keep capitals at the beginning of each complete thought. Word choice and order became more important. I read the poem aloud which I often forget to do. The word ""did"" in line 4 sounded harsh; I replaced it with the softer ""had."" I realized using the word ""intimacy"" wasn't necessary if I could show it; hence, the  addition of ""their knees touched."" I saw the poem could be written in couplets. My parents' beautiful, but irreligious, ritual became a kind of eucharistic celebration. I didn't need the words ""life-saving."" ""Transparent snake"" would do. ""Can"" was replaced with ""cup"" and my mother's words were ""offered"" reinforcing the image of communion. Hopefully, the poem now presented a simple, but active image- an icon for my brother. I could now change the title.  The use of Mayer's prompting freed me to experiment with/within my own creativity. The following version seems more true, clear, vivid and, certainly, more concentrated.  I am thankful.                                      

ICON FOR MY BROTHER, THE MONK,

WHO WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE THERE 

The last time I saw them together

our father had a feeding tube

Our mother made his meals a feast

as she always had

She pulled her wheelchair close

Their knees touched

One hand lifted a cup

The other that transparent snake

She began to pour

They didn't pray or give thanks

But she offered these words

This is how we lap dance

How deeply blue her eyes were

Death brought a deeper blue",2

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
Student 2 focusses on the question and title of the poem &ldquo;Why I am not a painter&rdquo;.
In very interesting manner ideas of student 2 about how the poem is written are discussed. I really like what you think about the word &ldquo;rather&rdquo;, &ldquo;drink&rdquo;, &ldquo;go&rdquo; and later on your explanation about orange and the number 12.
The work of the painter and the poet are compared and both groups of artist belong to the New York school and they shared many ideas. Perhaps the classification into poet or painter is a bit artificial and comes from the public opinion. You show up that in neither oeuvre the title occurs. New York school principals are although mentioned with a focus on the form of the poem.

21629,1348518723,I just logged on to evaluate my four assigned essays and was shocked how angry these interpretations are. All I can say is wow. ,2
74835,1352072983,"I do think they have gotten better since essay #1. There may be many factors, but one, surely, is that ModPo people are learning how to talk/write about this kind of poetry and to write confidently about formal matters as well as thematic matters.",1
28939,1348617340,"This is quite an interesting thread. I quite instinctively like [REDACTED]'s imagistic interpretation - the irony and whimsy of the female meeting male; old meeting new, which also picks up on [REDACTED] 'new morality' pitched against age old *Washi* traditions. Read this way, it's a powerful, delicate and beautiful poem, rich with nuance and sensual charge - the momentary experience or ephiphany of the fingers touching as a kind of electric shock of sudden awareness - much like ""In a Station of the Metro"". 

Simultaneously, the interpretation taken in the Kelly House video--that real notions of physical attraction, human interaction and sensuality with all its real-life complexities are objectified in this poem--is equally compelling (though it makes this a less moving, less rich poem). I suspect that the former might have been intentional and the latter unintentional on Pound's part. Nevertheless, Pound's later move to Vorticism with its heavy abstractions supports this interpretation.  ",2

Once youâ€™ve noted and remarked on whether the essay discusses these things, comment on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay does so.Does the paper say something about how Dickinsonâ€™s dashes works? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay deals with the dashes? Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly it discusses how the poemâ€™s form interacts with its content. For most essays that deal with this topic, the discussion will describe the way in which the speakerâ€™s figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble.Does the way the poem is written account for â€“ or befit â€“ the â€œstoryâ€ being told about the speaker? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay handles this issue.Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the paper account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
This essay does much more than paraphrase the poem, carefully using information gathered from the poem to support the author's interpretation. In contrast to other essays that I have read on the topic, this essay gave me more insight and was more thought-provoking. It discusses the ""how"" of the poem - how Dickinson used punctuation and capitalization, for example, to convey images and feelings. Although the essay talks about other types of punctuation, it does not specifically discuss the use of dashes and the effect they have on the reader. The author discussed the stanzaic form and its relation to a pub ballad. Beyond this, it doesn't specifically address the drunken feeling that the reader is meant to experience through the poem. 
The essay clearly describes a meta-poem with the intoxication of the poem's subject being Dickinson's creativity and the kind of naughtiness of the drunkard relating to the rule-breaking of the poem itself. It does not specifcially address the shifts in metaphor and why Dickinson moved from a human drunkard to insect or from inside a pub to outside in the flower bed. It does bring up and nicely support a spiritual component, relating the Landlord to the gods, for example. Overall, the essay was well-considered and provocative with the author's interpretation well-supported and interesting. Nice job.

The author should, in the future, keep in mind that no one point in history has a monopoly on poetry.  Pound probably would not have much liked this style, but a lot of people didn't like his style several decades earlier, and we'll come to some modern poets soon enough which are stranger still.  Every genre/movement has it's exceptional practitioners, history usually filters out many of the ones who weren't so good.  You probably won't find a truly bad imagist poet still published, but you can probably go to an open mic and hear countless terrible poets (and maybe a good one who will stick around).
Sorry, the essay began with a complaint of poetry, so I began with an apology.  The essay offers the simple explanation at the end, that O'Hara likes to have lots of words and flexibility, and thus he is not a painter.  Of the essays I've read, this seems to be the best guess at the central question.
I think that the author attempted to read too closely (a hard poem to do line by line, but I guess it's what Al asked for) and got overwhelmed, because the numbering of lines kind of trails off, and a lot is left out.  I had not seen a good reading of ""I drink; we drink"" as merely a moment of friendship, I'm glad that this line got some attention.
Overall, I'd just replace the opening paragraph with some more insights into the actual poem, good essay.

You do a good job of pointing out the consistent use of metaphor throughout your paper, additionally comparing Dickinson's conceit to other poets you are familiar with (text to text). Your comments clearly identify the euphoria expressed by Dickinson and you quote liberally from the work to support your claims. I like your insight about the poet's increasing spirituality; I think you make a very good point here. You further build on this insight into the pagen ""rites, celestial desires and spiritual images"" by talking about her ""union with nature."" You chose to do a line by line analysis in which you reveal much of the thematic elements of the poem rather than focusing on the structural aspects.

7465,1347637254,"Putting a 'slant' on something, to my mind, refers pretty specifically to language and how we say things. A main question that this poem throws up for me is:

Can we ever say something without a slant?

Because words are, in a very real sense, the sum of our experiences concerning that word up until that point: Think of the different reactions to the word 'home', for example, that are experienced by, firstly, someone who is comfortable in their home (which they may take for granted), and then by someone who is exiled from their own country and people of birth...

I don't think this is what ED is getting at though. What I hear her saying (today, anyways!) is that direct experience qualifies language, and that the full breadth/understanding of truth is a gradual process by necessity given our human condition... even if we told the whole truth, would the listener/reader be in an experiential position to understand it?

This poem suggests that 'all the truth' can be expressed in words however... Which leads me to the question: What are those words!?

I agree with the view above; that truth, either in experience or words, is a construct... and yet some things appeal to people as more universally 'true' than others in terms of how they successfully capture certain realities about our human existence.

The very fact that everyone constructs their own truth can itself be said to represent a universal truth.

Also, in the real flow of things, is language and meaning in some way abstracted from 'reality', from the truth? Is to consider it so not imposing a un-holistic discrimination against what is 'real' and what is not? In order, for example, to write a poem, the poet must have a lot of words and their attendant, communally agreed meanings along with the poet's accompanying experiences which colour the meaning of those words and create associations in the poet's mind... to negate any aspect of that as 'abstract' surely takes away from what must be the very real process that led to the real thing that we see before us on the page: A poem is its words/meanings, and the poet's personal experiences of these, just like a cake in no small part exists due to the recipe and cooking instructions that went into its making at whatever stage.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
The condensing of the poem is thoroughly treated by the author of this essay, with a sound argument outlining details of how this distillation and simplification has been achieved. Indeed, some interesting suggestions as to the  context of this image are suggested in the second paragraph, which would reay warrant greater discussion. How valid are these suggestions? What evidence supports them? 
 
The treatment of Version 1 is thorough and the author astutely details the ways in which the poem is more ""diffuse"" as well as some further suggestive and interesting thoughts on what is going on in the image presented to the reader. 
 
All together a thoughtful and fascinating essay which is well argued - I would be keen to hear more detail on some of the suggestions that are made but naturally this is a challenge within the confines of a short essay. In addition the informal and practical style in which it is written is highly refreshing - well done [REDACTED]!

I like your essay very much. There are some points in the rubric you didn't cover (such as the subjectivity of the speaker, or the prepositions), but you did a great job comparing the language of the first version and that of the second. I agree, Imagist poetry requires the reader to ""read in"" details that are not there (such as why the woman is crying), rather than trying to clarify everything. Paradoxically, the second version is much more clear than the first and you noticed that well. You noticed another paradox - that the second version follows more ""rules"" when it comes to form. You have made me see things in a different light and I am grateful for that.

1. Yes, the essay talks about the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing. The writer also accounts for the meaning created by the juxtaposition between the original and the edited version of the poem he used.
2. The essay does not exactly go in depth into the writer's thoughts on the virtues and vices of this mode of writing, but he does talk about how the process of this experiment gave him a sense of letting go.
I think it's really interesting how the writer of this essay continued on to eliminate other aspects of the poem when he found that he was unsatisfied with the initial ""written-through"" version. Very insightful essay!

While this is a quaint interpretation of the poem, or imposition of one's own visceral response to the poem, and does to some degree engage superficially with the basic content, form is not touched on (capitalized key words, line/sentence/stanza breaks.. clearly denoted cultural allusions that can be researched with ease). I am not sure this is as close a reading as we have learned to do by this point in the class.
WHAT is the drinking metaphor you refer to? Drinking is an action and becoming drunk is a process but what is Emily talking about in addition to what is obvious. There is most often underlying meaning and shifting of meaning. Yes, the poem does point to some beautiful nature, but the nature you are referring to is also it's own metaphor. 
The visuals you claim are associated with lines such as ""Inebriate of Air -- Am I"" is actually not particularly evocative of imagery, at least not as a isolated statement. Where is Emily (and where are we) according to the imagery she actually provides within the poem? Recall the ""geography of mind"" that is often present in Dickinson's work which was touched on a bit in the video discussions.
I could go on, but to be frank, you wrote a decent amount and still managed to make no insightful contribution to my (and other readers') understanding. Even the paraphrasing here is lazy. It is acceptable to pick and choose (to some degree) words and phrases that stand out for you, but whole swaths of interesting material are, for all intents and purposes, ignored.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
Essay goes into painting vs. poetry aspect well. There is only a cursory nod to the 'I do this...that' form and no mention of meta-poetics or parataxis. There is considerable work done on the subject of the poem that would be enhanced by the use of some connective material. Examples might be how this poem or the movement works with Stein's concerns or Dickinson's ""Dwell in Possibilty.""

The essay, which includes the mesostic which it reffers to  makes a clear and interesting speculation about the relationship between the spine, the source text and the mesostic obtained. The author builds his arguments on his understanding of and relation to the source text.
The author finds that the whole mesostization process makes no sense because man will always try to get meaning even where it does not exist, provided that he is stimulated.

Your analysis is really interesting; you provide a way to get under the skin of the poem, and see a larger meaning in it. I find particularly graceful your interpretation of the metaphor in the stanza: ""Inebriate of air ... And debauchee of dew"" with the reference to fairies. The images evoked help establish the relation between nature and human delights present through the poem.
Overall your essay is very well written and enjoyable and find a significant way to describe the story in the way that the writer maybe wanted to tell.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
Wow.. What a great poem... I am rather at a loss at how to evaluate it. And, tossing the guidelines found in the evaluation rubric, I must admit that I enjoyed enjoyed these Variations on the Lunch Poems and its delicious stanzas very much. It is packed with delightful, rolling-on-your tongue alliterations, so dear to my [REDACTED] ear (swiss mussy muss mustard...), and surprising insights into O'Hara's poem itself. That Goldberghad forsaken images for letters is a take is a reading that didn't occur to me, but I feel it is true. And hence the conclusion: Is the poem asking whether you can be a painter without being a poet or a poet without being a painter? Upon reading this, I experienced one of those 'aha' moments, and I am only too grateful to have been given the chance to read this remarkable submission. My only worry is that my evaluation didn't do it justice because it requires a close reading of itself... But anyway, great job!

Essay
There are several important part to the Imagist manifesto as we explore two variations of one poem called ""Young Woman at a Window"" by William Carlos Williams.
The first part of the manifesto directs the poet ""[t]o use the language of common speech, but to employ the exact word, not the nearly-exact, nor the merely decorative word.""
Some of the major changes in the two versions reside in the word choices. In version 1 the poem begins with ""while"" whereas in version 2 it begins with ""she sits"", so the poem moved from the notion of a temporary act of sitting to the definitive act of sitting. The version 1 poems also claims that the child has robbed her of something but when compared to the telling that the child only has his nose pressed to the glass in version 2 were are again moved from the notion of implication to that which he is doing, presented in such a way as to use exact wording to convey an idea.
The second part of the manifest claims ""We believe that the individuality of a poet may often be better expressed in free verse than in conventional forms. In poetry, a new cadence means a new idea.""
Both poems, as present above in the assignment follow a similar free verse convention and can, at first glance, appears exceedingly similar.
The third aspect of the manifesto calls for ""Absolute freedom in the choice of subject.""
The subject in both poems is a crying woman with a child on her lab. They both, however, seem to explore different things. In version 1, the theme is dominated by the idea that the child unknowingly and possibly unintentionally robbed this woman of something. One can assume it might be something like the freedoms afforded to one who is not committed to children, a lament on the changes of parenthood. In version 2 were are left with more ideas to ponder as the source of her tears. That the child has his nose pressed to the window seems to imply that there is something the child sees or is waiting to see. Ideas may form that the woman was lamenting a loss while the child was expecting to see that which the woman was crying about, possibly the father who had left or a child care provider who had quit and that the woman was saddened by this action while the child awaited the return unaware that it was in vain.
The forth aspect of the Imagist Manifesto calls for the poet ""To present an image. We are not a school of painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous. It is for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet, who seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art.""
When we consider the two poems, version 2 allows for the visual imagery to create the story as the reader begins to picture the ideas in the poem. In the poem presented as version 1, we are provided with sentiment, which clouds the visual representation of the poem with un-seeable notions of robbery and theft as being the reasons for the crying.
The manifesto ask the poet ""To produce a poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite.""
Similar to the ideas in the previous item of the manifest that was discussed, this calls for straight talk. The version 1 poem provides the read with blurred and indefinite ideas in how it reveals the child in the lap, as being the thief and cause for tears in the woman. The child in version 2 is minimally described except for the fact that it has its nose pressed against glass
Lastly, the manifesto calls for the poet to adhere to the idea ""that concentration is of the very essence of poetry.""
One can experiencedtwo distinct forms on mental interpretation. In the version 1 poem one may be left to pondering almost immediately the reason behind the child's thievery. It was the information and idea that was provided clearly and became a central focus of the poetic analysis. In version 2, if read separate from the version 1, it appears that there is merely a presentation of facts. This causes for a deeper concentration on the imagery provided and lends itself to thinking the poem more like a painting, to explore the poem as pieces of a puzzle to be concentrated upon and discerned.

The writer did not paraphrase the poem.  However, I felt I was reading more of a biography of Emily - more then I really cared to know.  A lot of time and thought was put in to the paper - much of it very interesting.  Some differences of interpretation are enevitable as in the final stanza.  My feel was Emily was saying thatnot a chance in hell that Seraphs or Saints would thus behave as there was no way she was giving up her adiction to the nectar of life.
 
Saw no mention of use of dashes.
 
Stanzaic for was mentioned only in passing.  No real review of the method or use of it.
 
ED's use of the Stanziac form was I believe, perfect for the short story being told.  Brief, punchy lines  - no wasted verbiage really exciting reading.  I don't think the author of the essay covered that.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Original poem:
There they go marching all in step so gay!Smooth-cheeked and golden, food for shells and guns.Blithely they go as to a wedding day,The mothers' sons.
The drab street stares to see them row on rowOn the high tram-tops, singing like the lark.Too careless-gay for courage, singing they goInto the dark.
With tin whistles, mouth-organs, any noise,They pipe the way to glory and the grave;Foolish and young, the gay and golden boysLove cannot save.
High heart! High courage! The poor girls they kissedRun with them: they shall kiss no more, alas!Out of the mist they stepped-into the mistSinging they pass.
 
This poem centres around young men joining the army and being sent off to war. Glancing over it, you can clearly see how the adjectives help to form the poem and emphasise the depth. As a reader, there is an overall feeling of sadness to this poem, for example ""food for shells and guns"" suggests that the men are bait and will be killed in battle, even though the men, the subject of it, seem happy. However there is a stark contrast between the men's excitement at going off - they are full of courage and believe the propoganda that they will return - and the reality that they may die.
 
Keeping the Bernadette Mayer Experiment in mind, I will now remove all the adjectives from the poem and talk about the changes:
 
There they go marching all in step so gay!Smooth-cheeked and golden, food for shells and guns.Blithely they go as to a wedding day,The mothers' sons.
The drab street stares to see them row on rowOn the high tram-tops, singing like the lark.Too careless-gay for courage, singing they goInto the dark.
With tin whistles, mouth-organs, any noise,They pipe the way to glory and the grave;Foolish and young, the gay and golden boysLove cannot save.
High heart! High courage! The poor girls they kissedRun with them: they shall kiss no more, alas!Out of the mist they stepped - into the mistSinging they pass.
 
By removing the adjectives, a lot of the hopefulness of the poem gets taken away. The boys are no longer ""smooth cheeked and golden"", but simply ""food for shells and guns"". They aren't going ""blithely"" but just going; maybe this way they are in fact worried about what lies ahead and not as optimistic. The removal of ""mothers'"" suggests that these young men don't belong to anybody, and it adds to the feeling of sadness, while also emphasising how so many men went off to war. 
 
The line ""singing like the lark"" hints at freedom. Are the boys really free because they have the opportunity to leave home and fight for their country, or would limitation actually be better, as it would keep them safe? 
 
There is also something to be said about how removing these words changes the structure of the poem. The original structure has an alternate line rhyming scheme and a linear syllable scheme. This gives the feeling of marching, much like the boys are marching off. However when the words are taken out, these schemes are no longer present and it could be said that this echoes the unpredictability of what they are embarking on.

Your personal story aspect of the essay is amusing. You went from ""I flinch at the task. It feels so seedy, like skulking near a filthy pawn shop with a thieved heirloom.""

To

""I am immediately embarrassed to find Emily Dickinson in my house, sitting beside me, patiently explaining the pronouns that encompass us; the master and his gun, the poet and her tasks, the poet and her world, the reader and the writer. I find myself in the most intimate of conversations with the original poet, apologetically and tentatively enquiring whether she may have meant me too.""

Essay
Manifesto 1. To use the language of common speech, but to employ the exact word, not the nearly-exact, nor the merely decorative word.
Version 2 of ""Young woman at a window"" is precise.  It snapshots a moment of time and there is nothing very referential about it.  It describes in crystal clear tones the shape and outline of a scene.  In Ver. 1, there is a kind of ambiguity; a hinting at rather than incising out.  Version 2 is like a lino cut of shapes.  The woman; the tears; the child on her lap; nose against a window pane.  We don't need to read anything more into this vignette.  It is what it is.  Ver. 1 however, reads like a tome of nuances. There is a cascade of story, particularly embedded in the lines ""who robs her.""  How intruiging!  Ver 2 has none of ""that"" - it delineates in an almost matter-of-fact way the outline rather than emeshing itself in subterranean twists. 
Manifesto 2. We believe that the individuality of a poet may often be better expressed in free verse than in conventional forms. In poetry, a new cadence means a new idea.
Ver 1 feels more like a ""traditional"" poem in the sense that it references nuances and details that evoke rather than explain.  Ver 2 seems quite prosaic and even the sound of it, read aloud, is cadenced in sharp, critiqued bursts of sound.  This version appears to free WCW to take the stance of an austere overseer.  Ver 1 encapsulates him inside the story of the poem - but he's more diffuse and sublimated as the characters in the story tend to take over.  Ver 2 provides him with the stronger voice as the characters in the poem are less characters than shapes to be drawn. 
Manifesto 3. Absolute freedom in the choice of subject. 
Ver 2 does not free the image from itself.  It does however free the reader to see the image in as much clarity as they choose.  ""Pressed to the glass"" - this phrasing provides a kind of unambiguous meme.  It's almost obvious - there's not much obtuse or unclear about it.  The thing is ""pressed"" against ""the glass"" - the glass is a window, a drinking vessel, a mirror, a toy.  We do not know and it does not matter.  The choice in the subject is the pressing, not the glass itself.
Manifesto 4. To present an image. We are not a school of painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous. It is for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet, who seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art. Ver 2 does appear more painterly of the two versions.  Ver 1 is novel'esque.  It imbues the characters with souls and elusive qualities surreptitiously captured wholelistically throughout the telling. Ver 2 however draws us to the shape of the scene as a whole.  It squares off the language, rendering it down to the simplest of terms. Manifesto 5. To produce a poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite.
Ver 2 has an edginess to it that Ver 1 just doesn't have.  There are less syllables (I think), and it's curt in its tonal quality.  It is definitely clearer than Ver 1 in that the words are so prosaic and everyday.  The language flows in different tonal qualities despite there being only ever two or three words per row.  Somehow, ""She sits with tears on her cheek"" reads entirely differently than ""While she sits there.""  ""While she sits there"" comes across as evocative of a memory, a theme, an embellishment in the story.  ""She sits"" is entirely what it is. A clear thing that IS and cannot be otherwise.
6. Finally, most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence of poetry.Ver 2 is the ""condensary"".  It shifts nothing to the subjective gaze but everything to the external observational viewpoint.  It pulls everything from around the hard clean lines of its form into a clarity of purpose that isn't out to teach, sway, cajol, lure, enmesh or intertwine.  Ver 2 states emphatically and with a resolute force of will on the part of WCW that it feels quite intensive - almost hard.  Vers 2 is definitively the imagist version of this poem.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
The first stanza introduces a metaphor which will give the tone to the whole poem. The first line demonstrates that the speaker experiences a kind of ecstatic pleasure comparable to alcoholic beverage intoxication, but that liquor has never been brewed, or rather, it is not effectively a drink. In fact, it is served in a &ldquo;tankard craved in pearl&rdquo;, which highlights the preciousness or rarity of her experience. It is important to notice that the metaphor conveys experience which would otherwise be difficult to explain.
From this point on, it is possible to guess that the speaker&rsquo;s experience transcends the physical world and suggests the unity between the self and the surrounding nature. The metaphor of drunkenness stands for her intoxication with the beauty of nature.
The Vats upon the Rhine mentioned in the following lines possibly barrels containing a type of vine of great value and exquisite taste. Even so, they would never be able to produce such a kind of experience.
The speaker is a special &ldquo;drunkard&rdquo;, for she is &ldquo;inebriated of air&rdquo;, drunk on &ldquo;dew&rdquo;, reeling from &ldquo;inns of Molten Blue&rdquo;, that is, from a sky which seems to be fluid and it effectively fills her whole being up, as if it were a tavern from which the liquor flowed uninterruptedly. Being in such a state, she staggers through the endless summer days.
There are some formal aspects which sound relevant, like the poet&rsquo;s choice of formal words to refer to her special kind of addiction: inebriate, debauchee. The choice seems to emphasize the spiritual nature of her intoxication.
The metaphor shifts when she likens herself to bees and butterflies, which imbibe the nectar from flowers, but differently from bees, which have to leave the closing flower, not to be trapped, and butterflies, which give up gathering nectar from flowers after having taken their &ldquo;drams&rdquo;( a small drink of liquor), the speaker will be able to continue drinking from nature spiritual liquor endlessly.The last stanza begins with the word &ldquo;Till&rdquo; indicating that it refers to the previous line, to the length of her drinking: until seraphs, the highest order of angels, shake their &ldquo;snowy Hats&rdquo; and saints hurry to &ldquo;the windows of Heaven&rdquo; to watch her, a little Tippler, &ldquo;Leaning against the &ndash; Sun &ndash;&ldquo;.
Alliteration in the line &ldquo;Till seraphs swing their snowy hats&rdquo; suggests a wind blowing the clouds, perhaps to observe clearly that &ldquo;little Tippler&rdquo;, who is drunk with summer's splendor.
The word &ldquo;Tippler&rdquo; seems to have a double meaning: it might refer either to a spiritual drunkard, who recognizes her smallness before the vastness of nature, or to a flying tippler, a kind of pigeon, &mdash;a possible metaphor for the soul in its connection to Paradise. This interpretation may find support in the Transcendentalist idea that finding God depended on neither orthodox creedalism nor the sensible exercise of virtue, but on one's inner striving toward spiritual communion with the divine spirit, which is immanent in nature. Divinity is self-contained, internalized in every being.
Obviously the dash before the word &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; sounds provocative, as if the speaker were providing a kind of suspense regarding the thing against which the Tippler would be leant. The Sun&rsquo;s position suggests the end of a day, that is, sunset. Thus, there is a possibility that the poem be a summary of the activities of a whole day.
On the other hand, there is another dash after the word &ldquo;Sun&rdquo;, whose connection with the heavenly imagery of the last stanza suggests that she would never stop drinking that spiritual nectar; her drinking would be eternal. The creative insight and interpretation of the poet&rsquo;s inner voices would last forever through her words. Thus, the final dash is a pause, but not a period, not an end.

To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
The ""How"" of the Poem:  This essay writer did, in my view, an excellent job in paraphrasing the poem and seems very comfortable in doing it.  He/she provides rich detail that illuminate the sparse verse, and tells the story that Dickinson may be attempting to tell.  She does relate the poem to Dickinson's own life (biographical fallacy?), but does not explain why such a prim and proper Amherst woman would be reeling in drunkenness.  This is unanswered, except to perhaps suggest that she is feeling intoxicated, but only in her imagination. I wonder if Dickinson ever really personally experienced drunkenness; else, how could she describe it?
Dashes: The essay-writer mentions ""the only non-dash punctuation in the whole piece"" - the exclamation point.  She does not attribute any significance to that beyond pointing it out.
Form: The essay writer does mention meter, syllables and stanzas but, again, does not assign significance to them.
Story:  The essay writer handles the story in a very entertaining way; I found the essay just as enjoyable as the poem, and perhaps even more so.  I didn't have to dig as hard! He/she seems content not to pull all of the pieces together--bees, inns, seraphims, etc.--and perhaps that is how it should be.  
Shift in Metaphor/Conceit:  The essay writer seems to observe that the second stanza ""establishes the metaphor of the liquor of life,"" but does not explain that relationship very fully.  There is perhaps a tiny leap of faith made by the essay writer in equating form with literary meaning.  But I thouroughly enjoyed being a witness as he/she explored it.  A wonderful essay.

This essay is delightful.  Linking the mesostics algorithm to Orwell is a thought provoking and ulitmately satisfactory idea.  Both Cage and Orwell explored the eradication of ego, but to Cage it was a liberating experience and to Orwell, it was, well, Orwellian.  The contrast between the versificator and Cage, and the beauty of the versificator-generated song, opens up new ways to think about chance.  
The author's comment that he or she is trying not to analyze how closely the mesostics capture the sprit of Orwell's characters is intriguing.  Why is that something to be avoided?  I am not saying that instinct is right or wrong, and I would love to be able to discuss with the author if any line of inquiry into mesostics is better than any other.  
The author's comments on the coldness of the opening lines of the mesostics is a good close reading.  It brings to mind the source used.  
Now I have to go back and re-read 1984 to see what Orwell's view of chance poetry is, and whether he gives any examples in the book.  Thank you for making another piece of literature so urgent!

77014,1352610897,"I have really enjoyed following this thread. For me, and it sounds like for others, there came a point when I needed to define my stance towards the experience of the course as much as the poetry that was its nominal subject. How much time and effort could I devote to metapedagogical analysis? This moment of judgment happened around â€œThis is Just to Sayâ€ in week 3. I posted the note below in a discussion forum on that poem, and it has remained a useful perspective as the poems have gotten harder to â€œglimpseâ€ ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED]'s term for that evanescent connection to a something in a poem) and the messages from the seminar room became more lyric. And there have been several other poems and forums since then that have resonated with me, especially discussions of â€œOctober in the Railroad Earthâ€, â€œI Know a Manâ€, and â€œSome Treesâ€. So Iâ€™ve really benefited from â€œgo with the flowâ€ but couldnâ€™t have done it without adopting â€œan attitudeâ€ as described in this re-treaded post. With apologies.

I will approach the ModPo experiment as an invitation to outsiders of all backgrounds to look inside a faith-based community and participate in its rituals. I am grateful to Prof. [REDACTED] and his colleagues for opening up their faith in the power of Modernist poetry to enrich peopleâ€™s lives for our examination. But skepticism, as we hear in this thread, is a good place to start.

I assume that the poems that we are reading form the foundational structure of that faith. This course asks only that we invest some time and effort (no money yet!) to examine the architecture of that foundation. Sometimes, I suppose, in digging into these poems we will feel a resonance with our own experience that is reassuring or comforting or fortifying, and we will sing along with the choir. For me that has happened with â€œIn a Station of the Metroâ€, â€œIt isnâ€™t for Wantâ€, and â€œThis is Just to Sayâ€. Sometimes we will see only a reliquary that can be hidden away in a jeweled box and worshiped by the faithful. But the examination is the thing, and now I feel itâ€™s up to me to understand how and why those poems that do resonate work, and the ways that that insight might be put to meaningful use in my life.",2

You have done a good job of pulling this poem apart, looking at the various pieces and laying out what they might mean in terms of drinking.  Your essay stays quite close to the literal meaning, rather than the symbolic meaning, of the poem.  You have also done well with showing the porgression of the poem through stages of drunkenness.  There is a missing dimension, I think -- namely What is the meaning of the drunkenness?  What does the drunkenness stand for?  You suggest some possibilities in your comments on the line ""I shall but drink the more.""  Your essay would be strengthened by following that theme through the rest of the poem to see how it developed.  You handle the shift Dickenson makes between the first two stanzas and the last two stanzas.  But you could make your essay stronger if you commented on Dickenson's use of dashes.  (I know.  I didn't do this either.  Too much going on in the words for me to think of that.)

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
This essay touches on the question of subjectivity even if it is more focused on a technical examination of language. It moves to examine the use of more specific language and the removal of interpretative ambiguity, but not more etchincal aspects like the use of prepositions. Laudably, the essay also acknowledges that both poems are imagist.

Essay
What is Imagism and how did it come to be? Imagism officially began in the year 1912 when Ezra Pound sent one of Hilda Doolittle's poem to Harriet Monroe, signed and marked with ""H.D. Imagism"". Imagism describes a major movement in poetry that favors vivid imagery and clear, sharp language and expressions. A poem must adhere to six rules in order for it to be considered an imagism. The Imagist Manifesto states that an imagist poem (1) does not use any word that does not contribute whatsoever to the whole presentation, (2) it is presented and expressed in free verse, (3) it offers a freedom in terms of subject, (4) it presents a vivid image through its choice of words, (5) it produces a clear and hard element in whole, and lastly, (6) it concentrates on one subject or theme. It is said that William Carlos Williams wrote Young Woman at a Window under the influence of imagism, however, the different versions create a conflict in which the second version is more imagist than the first.
William Carlos Williams expresses both versions of Young Woman at a Window in a free verse manner. He does not follow any rhyme scheme or any stanzaic form. William Carlos Williams also provides absolute freedom regarding the choice of subject in both versions. He leaves room for open discussion. In addition, Williams presents an image in both versions. He renders particulars rather than dealing with vague generalities. For example, in version 2, we can clearly visualize the child's foggy breath against the window as he presses his nose to the glass. Williams uses direct treatment of the image itself. So far, we have proved that both versions are perhaps imagism through its use of three out of six rules in the manifesto. However, where does that leave the other three?
From the very first look at version 2, we can already see how it uses the language of common speech. Williams added unnecessary words to version 1, such as while (line 1), there (2), and little (7), that when taken out, will not change the meaning of the poem. Williams also makes the story more vague in version 1 by adding the excerpt, ""...the little child who robs her know nothing of his theft..."" (7-10), leaving room for questions and vagueness, thus, breaking rule #5. Version 2 produces an element that is hard and clear. Williams is straight to the point in this version rather than approaching poetry's traditional way of making their readers dig dip for the meaning. In addition, version 2 better concentrates on the subject, the woman and her child. It is also more condensed, allowing its readers to focus solely on what the woman and the child is doing. William Carlos Williams uses condensery in version 2 which is what a poet should do according to Lorine Niedecker&rsquo;s poem, Poet's work.
It is clear to see that version 2 adhered to all six rules in the Imagist manifesto. Although the first version provides more information and has more to the story, version 2's condensed and straightforward nature definitely makes is more imagist than the first.

The essay leaves the possibles interpretations of the poem (the image of Madonna and child for example) aside.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
This is a good essay that discusses some points that I have personally missed in my close reading of the poem. Thanks to this essay which discusses the writer's views on the poem point-by-point, I also have a better understanding of O'Hara's poem. 
The writer managed to find the irony in the poem and discussed the poem in detail. Good job.

This essay definitely does more than paraphrase the poem- explains the stanzas, poetic devices and the choice of words. It has a unique way of dealing with the punctuation. It explains the form of the poem from the get-go and gets very detailed about the form of the poem. (As a novice, I do not think of myself as qualified to evaluate this part)
The writer seems to be following the poet's use of dashes quite literally in their close reading of the work. In my view, this is done effectively although the dashes are not mentioned, but at the beginning the form of the poem is explained clearly.
The author clearly explains the stanzaic form and this is done quite effectively.
the story of the poem is very well explained and the paper follows the shift in metaphor and does this very well and in great detail.

The essay definitely more than paraphrases and explains the phrases of the poem.  The second meaning of the poem as being a response to Whitman is remarkable.
The essay takes in account the form and style of the poet and the undersanding of the movement of the metaphors in the seasons is evident.
A very interesting interpration in more than one way.

60989,1350916532,"Does the impersonal ""one"" indicate the mechanical way in which we go about our daily lives when we grieve?

Although the title says, ""A Step Away From Them,"" the speaker is actually moving away from the ""my"" and ""I"" in the beginning of the poem closer to ""A Negro,"" ""A blonde,"" ""A lady"" and then on to ""several Puerto Ricans."" It is right after that, at the moment the speaker mentions how the Puerto Ricans makes the avenue ""beautiful and warm"" that he lists his friend's deaths: 

""First / Bunny died, then John Latouche, /then Jackson Pollock.""

Then the speaker asks: ""But is the earth as full as life was full, of them?""

It is as if he is feeling their absence more acutely in that warm and lively avenue, and his actions become mechanical: ""And one has eaten and one walks."" He has stepped outside of himself almost, and stepped away from those around him in the avenue to speak privately to his sorrow, but then pulls himself back to the rich life surrounding him, and to what remains important and what endures: 

""My heart is in my / pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.""

I like what you&rsquo;ve done here. It seems a very bold choice to take a poem that is a list of instructions (and thus necessarily depends on action) and then excise its verbs. What is, indeed, interestingly remarkable about your result is that one can still sort of discern the process.
What is frustrating about your essay is that I want more. I&rsquo;d like to see even more of the analysis you do so well (maybe a close reading of a couple of lines, like &ldquo;the poem you&rdquo; or &ldquo;as long as you your poem&rdquo;) and an exploration of what you see as the value of an exercise like this.

14156,1348309936,"My knowledge of Greek philosophy is quite limited, but all the time during the discussion of the difference between Dickinson and Whitman there was at the back of my mind a feeling of having been in a similar tension zone before. Now I believe to have found where I have encountered it before: Isnâ€™t Plato a philosopher of ideas and Aristotle more one of the appreciation of the multitude of experiences, which he liked to enumerate in catalogues? Isnâ€™t that something of a parallel to our two poets here? And doesnâ€™t Dickinsonâ€˜s habit of capitalization somehow even stress her adherence to ideas? Also, she talks about a â€žTruthâ€œ she wants to tell, but she has to tell it slant, because, just as in Platoâ€™s Allegory of the Cave, we canâ€™t bear to know Truth in an unfiltered way (which would make Dickinson herself the Romantic poet, the intermediator between Truth and us, all eyeball, who can take it and filter it for us.) If any of you is knowledgeable about Greek philosophy, please tell me if you agree to this parallel.

32722,1348739063,"Duchamp is one of my heroes. His wit and vision is always an inspiration to me. I love how he also provides people with a  subject to ridicule and show their ignorance upon, his work has so many places in our world. It is not just for the elite and educated, Duchamp is the great all-rounder.

Williams Carlos Williams also provides everyday images and everyday things for people to make of whatever they wish.  That is where he and Duchamp are alike.  They see the world and take it into their own experience, give it back to us transformed by their own emotional and intellectual stance.  

We can however in every case and with all other art since or before approach as if we are aliens from another planet, if we are that uninformed, and make of it whatever we like, that is how far art has travelled from representing the divine for the patrons who paid the price for the artist to do so.  Now, we have art giving us meanings from many places, angles and realities, it is a blown open world, can our minds expand or contract enough to see the possibilities?  it's possible that does not matter, but to me it does.

Surely, this is nonsense, and being deliberately obtuse would be just as bad as dumbing down.  I can imagine the musical equivalent would be someone who mistakes technical proficiency on an instrument with music itself.  Don't get me wrong.

Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing? If the short essay interpretation of the experiment does not address either of the issues identified above, base your peer review on any issues or questions that seem appropriate to the essay.
Sorry in this little essay there no much to say abot the poem but nevertheless it brightly shows the relationships betwen original source text, stem or spine work (here the word SLANT) and resulting mesostic. 
The essay in a very unique gives an explanation of the meanining of Emily Dickinson'es poem ""Tell all the truth"" which is not about approaching blind people but it presents something diametrically opposite. 
Taking into account the staight vertical wich is for ordinary people and a slanted vertical for blind people who are in need of eased explanation. 
This essay is very well done.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?

The essay was able to note the condensation of the poem by pointing out the disappearance of the narrative in the second poem.  It gave a good description of the second poem as blocks of words stacked upon another because that's really how it reads like when the emotional thread is removed.  It was also observant on the part of the essayist to note the change of cadence in the first poem.  Noting the order of description on the second poem was also a good observation as that's how the eye will move when viewing an image.

1. does not describe condensation of V.2 compared to V.1
2. Does discuss the use of ""while"" in setting up the motion in V.1, and says it causes the image to not be static like V.2.  Also discusses the use of ""theft"" and says that an attempt at describing an emotion cannot really use an exact word, which is in respect to the Imagist Manifesto.
3. no discussion of prepositions.
4. no discussion of the subjectivity of the speaker.
5. does not dicuss symbolism such as ""madona and child"", but the title is ""two portraits of mom and child""
Overall, this was a very short essay, and it is not my understanding if the writer is of a different mother language.
The general idea about that the first is an emotional description and is not static and that the second is static is the general interperetation of the Imagist mode, I believe.
writer could learn from the rubric in which we are supposed to comment on as a guide for future poem interperetation.

Not all the Vats upon the Rhine Yield such an Alcohol!    Could she be referring to German poetry? Music? Literature? as well?

Perhaps the liquor is the art of poetry as in I Dwell in Possibility.   Good. I would suggest exploring that more including other references in the poem as you did with: If the liquor is the art of poetry, it could be that it is this art that keeps her young and alive. Maybe she is telling us that poetry in general can keep us alive and heartened.
I think you are correct. That is what she is telling us.
Good pickup on the foxglove! I am certain that she did not choose a flower accidentally but it was a purposeful choice and you hit it on the head! (If one can hit a flower that way!)

I enjoyed your essay; in some cases you did what I did and that was to spend most of the time paraphrasing rather than breaking it down/apart. In my case it was because I am not familiar with close readings and metapoetry so I defaulted to my familiar style!

I looked at the splinter as the beginning of destruction.  The first splinter swirling off an old wheel or other mechanical device is its first sign of age or wear and a good indication that it will soon be useless or discarded.

The difficulty in putting flood waters back expresses to me the idea of unlearning or unknowing something.  Like trying to convince myself that there really is a Santa Claus or that the world is flat.

Perhaps this is a time and place where that is all that he thinks he needs to do, and that to insist would be unseemly and even reveal insecurity on his part. If he advises, she will naturally follow his advice. There is a cultural assumption in his advice. She is a woman and this is a capitalist society, perhaps with a Puritanical work ethic at that time. In this situation, grandfatherâ€™s advice follows the cultural norms that no decent person would contradict. It is almost a ritual for him to give this advice to his granddaughter and he perhaps does it without even seriously considering it.

This is the kind of advice that many women have been given for a long time. Even many men are given that message of learning a trade that will pay well, pay being a widely accepted measure of a jobâ€™s worth in a capitalist society. And for many people, a jobâ€™s worth is a lifeâ€™s worth. How many people pick a college major because they think it will be easier to find a well-paying job upon graduation? How many liberal arts majors are told that their major is risky, or even of questionable value?

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
On reading &ldquo;I taste a liquor never brewed&rdquo; by Emily Dickinson, the speaker begins with a warning that we are going off into the imaginary, not real &hellip;&rsquo;a liquor never brewed&rsquo; and stops us with a dash &ndash; pause and think about this before proceeding.
The poem is structured in four stanzas of four lines each, a medium short poem with meter 8686 and rhymes at the even number lines, XAXA. So it seems light, a little sing-song, pleasant and happy, telling a story. She uses capital letters where they are not ordinarily placed, to tell us that these are important, perhaps powerful and beautiful words&hellip;. Tankard (not a mere glass) &hellip;Pearl (beautiful and valuable) &hellip; Alcohol (a very strong kind, indeed finer than the excellent wines of the Rhine).
In the second stanza, she becomes drunk (Inebriate &ndash; am I) on air and Dew (refreshing and gentle). Could &ldquo;Debauchee of Dew&rdquo; be a little play on &lsquo;do&rsquo; or &lsquo;doing&rsquo;... to be morally led astray, indulging ones appetite for sensual pleasures? &rdquo; Reeling (like a staggering drunk) thro&rsquo; endless summer days &ldquo; (it&rsquo;s warm and pleasant). &ldquo;From inns of Molten Blue&rdquo;&hellip;like a traveler from an inn, flying through intensely and liquid blue skies. Then a dash, - let&rsquo;s pause a short second and catch our breath after all that reeling and flying.
In the third stanza she changes metaphors to things of Nature&hellip; a bee drunk on sweet honey, turned out of Foxglove&rsquo;s door (Digitalis,a drug for the heart) and butterflies have had enough of their tiny &lsquo;drams&rsquo; ( a unit of weight from &lsquo;drachma&rsquo;, an ancient Greek silver coin, precious). But she is defiant, she is not done and will only drink some more!
In the final stanza, she implies that she will keep on drinking until Heaven&rsquo;s highest angels, &ldquo;Seraphs&rdquo;, behaving like children &ldquo;swing their snowy hats&rdquo; (hats =halos &ndash; a ring of light that shines through ice crystals, symbolizing innocence or virtue). And even the &ldquo;Saints&rdquo; (the adults?) run to the windows (imaginary windows in Heaven or windows to the soul?) to see what? &ldquo;See the little Tippler (her, the drunk, but tippler is a kinder, softer word than drunk &ndash; will the Saints think of her as just a naughty little girl?) Leaning against the &ndash; (dash, pause &ndash; gasp) Sun! (surprise!) How happy! To lean on it you must be bigger that the Sun &ndash; is it low on the horizon, near sunset? If you can lean on the Sun you can do anything! To lean is to deviate from upright, also to lean on to depend upon for encouragement. The sun rises and sets every day, reliable, steady, warm and bright.
So ends her glorious day, high on air and dew and life! Where Whitman, too, describes the glory of Nature, he throws it open demanding us to see. Dickinson takes it all into her very being, possessing the world in her drunkenness, she tells us how it feels, in her own way. Life is good.
I would very much like to drink in the world with Emily&hellip; but that will also be &ldquo;a liquor never tasted&rdquo; indeed. But I can still imagine ....

At first I thought the &lsquo;liquor never brewed&rsquo; could be a metaphor for sunlight or the summer air or nature in general. I took &lsquo;Tankards scooped in Pearl&rsquo;, to mean that the sunlight or air doesn&rsquo;t come in richly ornamented vessels, but then I realised that alcohol isn&rsquo;t actually &lsquo;brewed&rsquo; in tankards, plus the capitals indicated that this was something significant in the poem. I then thought the &lsquo;Tankards scooped in Pearl&rsquo;, could be the sky, with the &lsquo;pearl&rsquo; being clouds. This sunlight or air is more intoxicating than the finest alcohol, &lsquo;not all the Vats upon the Rhine/ Yield such an Alcohol&rsquo;, the Rhine presumably being known for its fine alcohol at this period. The &lsquo;I&rsquo; of the poem is intoxicated by the very air, &lsquo;Inebriate of Air&rsquo; and &lsquo;debauchee&rsquo;, made unrestrained and self-indulgent by &lsquo;dew&rsquo;. Here I think as in so many of her poems Dickinson is using these metaphors to dual purpose, exaggerating to poke fun at herself, self-mocking, but also making the point that one doesn&rsquo;t need to be drunk on alcohol to have an intoxicating and exuberant appreciation of the world around you and the simple pleasures of nature. &lsquo;Reeling&rsquo; adds to this excitable, overcome exaggeration. She is not shut up in &lsquo;inns&rsquo; which although they serve alcohol are usually quite dark and shady compared to bright sunlight, instead the sky is her &lsquo;inn&rsquo;, &lsquo;inns of Molten Blue&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Molten&rsquo; emphasises the heat of the summer sky and the contrast of a shady traditional inn. Both &lsquo;Molten&rsquo; and &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; start with capitals to emphasise her preference for their heat and colour over the darker, cooler inn.
She intonates she is insatiable for sunlight, in that she will still want more when the bee and the butterflies have had their fill, the bee is turned out by the &lsquo;Landlord&rsquo; presumably for being too drunk, &lsquo;drunken Bee&rsquo;, and the butterflies &lsquo;Renounce their dram&rsquo;, have had as much as they can handle. Things are so much affected by this sunlight that the bee, usually portrayed as industrious, is here &lsquo;drunken&rsquo;.
She says even angels and saints will be excited by her intoxication with the sunlight, &lsquo;Seraphs swing their snowy Hats --/ And Saints -- to windows run --/ To see the little Tippler/ Leaning against the -- Sun &ndash;&lsquo; Angels swinging their hats and saints running to windows is reminiscent of them watching a parade passing by, a further exaggeration, since all there is to be seen is one &lsquo;Tippler&rsquo;, again a metaphor for being drunk, &lsquo;Leaning against the &ndash; sun&rsquo; is reminiscent of a drunk leaning against a lamp-post or wall, unable to stand upright, again a joke since by being teetotal instead of actually drunk, she is being upstanding or upright in the community&rsquo;s eyes. So this poem could be taken too as a temperance poem, saying you don&rsquo;t need to get drunk with alcohol to be happy or excited.
It also occurred to me that the &lsquo;inns of molten blue&rsquo; could be the &lsquo;foxgloves&rsquo; themselves, as in a field of flowers, reminiscent of Wordsworth&rsquo;s daffodils. Then the air she is &lsquo;inebriated&rsquo; with could be the perfume of the flowers. The &lsquo;dew&rsquo; could be the actual dew on the flowers and this reading is particularly backed up by the third stanza, when the metaphor for the bees turned out of the inn and butterflies renouncing their drams would be even more strongly knit if the &lsquo;inns&rsquo; were the foxgloves themselves. The &lsquo;tankards&rsquo; in the first stanza would be the cups of the flowers and the &lsquo;pearl&rsquo; the dew on the flowers.
The dashes seem to echo the staggering or reeling of a drunken inebriate.
The dash before the last word &lsquo;sun&rsquo; may emphasise that the poem is about the sun itself. &lsquo;Tippler&rsquo; could mean one&rsquo;s head tipped up to the sun to drink it in. Although then the bees being turned out and butterflies filled would seem to be a metaphor for the sun going down; and she couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;drink the more&rsquo; if the sun goes down.
As with most of Dickinson&rsquo;s poems, this poem is open to several interpretations. We may never know exactly what she meant but we can be enriched by our diligent search for meaning.

The writer of this essay enthusiastically addressed issues of metaphor and intersubjectivity.  The interpretation around the word ""Landlord"" was interesting as i spoke about the concept of ownership and who owns the poem, etc. She also addressed the meaning of Dickinson's use of quotation marks to imply another sense of the meaning,
While the writer did not address the dashes or stanzaic form, or specifically the shift in metapor, his or her own writing flitted about as an effective echoing of the poet's work.

I experience the imaginable which hasn't yet occurred
And the imaginable was Fine
And all the people who imagine today
Their imaginations pale by Mine.
 
Absorbed, drunk, in the atmosphere and breadth of my dream
fully embraced, in every carnal moist detail
Reeling, cartwheeling, pinballing through my middle years
under the temple of My revered sky.
 
When nature catches up with me
And tells me Time soon be no more
And hipsters park their fixie bikes
for winter, I keep open my door
 
Till death, he swingeth near his scythe
And ghosts, look out to see my song
To see my Jersey Wilde-ish display
coming to a close.

4742,1347416922,"I understood the poem rather differently from most of what I read and definitely from the video. I think the idea of kindness has not been given the weight it deserves.

1. One of the TAs mentioned that Emily was a woman and was forced to talk in a round-about way. That makes her look like a victim, trying to sneak in a little truth behind obfuscation. And I just can't see her do that; it doesn't fit with the rest of the poem, especially not the first four words.

I do instead think that she is pointing out a strength of women over men (generally of course), namely that kindness is very important in any interaction. One does not slant the truth to hide. And (contrary to [REDACTED]) I don't believe that talking about all related things and not about the cup, or talking about ancient myths is a kindness because it hides the truth too much.

2. The kindness we can give to others is to talk to them in a way they can understand it. I don't mean this in any paternalistic or patronizing way, but in a way that explores and respects the other. And withing this framework one is honest and straightforward. 

I never lied to my kids, but I did try to respond to what they wanted to know. I ""slanted"" the truth to their question which means *which* detail would be interesting to them and *how much* detail they could handle. Telling them more would have been unkind, but telling them less would also have been. I have never subscribed to the view that children need to be protected from certain truths (popular exclusions being death and sex). There are ways to be honest and respectful and at their understanding.

This does not have to be condescending. A teacher trying to teach calculus to her elementary school class would not only be unkind and disrespectful, she would also waste time. A teacher refusing to teach calculus to a specific, interested student merely because she is still in elementary school would be condescending. 

I liked the idea of *soft* light that one TA mentioned. The truth is not hidden, it is there to be seen, but it is not forced on the other. The truth is told in a circuit not to obfuscate or hide but to allow approach from different angles in different circumstances. For example, explaining lightning to a child which is scared in a lightning storm is different to explaining it to a curious kid who is asking why this tree is destroyed, or another scientifically minded kid who is interested why there is light and sound, etc.

In this context I also understand the phrase ""all the truth"". Since the poem is written as advice to the speaker, I take this to mean that the speaker has no right (or at least should avoid) to withhold truth for any reason other than kindness. And, in my opinion, the kindness can only be one about how it is told. Misleading is never kind.

In any case, I see the kindness of slant to be opposed to harsh directness which often does not respect the other.",3

Interesting poem. I really liked the concentration it exposed MM too. It was the most successful one I read during my evaluations.
I think you insert an unnecessary 'they' into the mix when you close read. I would see the first stanza as applicable to the title, so your 'they' becomes my 'Marianne Moore'. Strangely you seem to have not cut all nouns: dozen (in s1); ten (s2) and possibly Marianne (s2); and dark (s3).
I feel you miss the construct which because the method only allows nouns in the title means that the poems view concentrates on those objects. Many of the verbs loose their previous/original attachment to (other) nouns and attach to the title object.
Also, I found it interesting how the polysemic quality of 'the' allowed it a transformation into a pronoun (thee).
I found your speculation on how the method shifted and created new juxtapositions good though I thought you could have been more general about the effect of eliminating nouns. I don't recall you talking about the dropping of words beginning with 's' or discussing how this altered the original.

I like the thesis of this essay that liquor is a metaphor for industrialization of Dickinson&rsquo;s time, as opposed to the purity of nature. I wish the writer had developed this idea more using full quotes instead of just one word to explore the thesis. I also like the idea of the form of this poem being similar to the Psalms of the Bible. This idea should have been supported with quotes from both the Bible and this poem. I wish that the writer had written more about the form of this poem, as it relates to the content. It is important to look beyond the words Dickinson has written. The video discussion about Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;I dwell in possibility&rdquo;, talked about how you had to work to understand Dickinson&rsquo;s poems. The meaning of the poem is not as it always seems on the page. I personally believe that this is a meta-poem, a poem about the way poetry makes one feel as a writer or reader of poetry.
1 Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? Yes. The thesis of the essay contrasts the beauty of nature with industrialization. The writer of the essay used exact quotes from the poem to illustrate their thesis. The first paragraph used several single word quotes such as &ldquo; tippler&rdquo;, &ldquo;inebriate&rdquo;, and &ldquo;debauchee&rdquo;. I would have liked to see the full line quoted to help explain the writer&rsquo;s view about substance abuse and disgrace.2 Does the paper say something about how Dickinson&rsquo;s dashes work? No. The essay did not discuss the use of dashes to emphasize words or create a pause when reading a line.3 Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? The essay does not specifically state that there are four stanzas of four lines each in this poem. It does mention that the form of this poem is like that of the Psalms of the Bible. I like this idea, I just wish the writer had explained this more, and given specific example of how the two were similar.4 Does the way the poem is written account for &ndash;or befit- the story being told about the speaker? The writer of this essay does not explain the story told by each stanza of this poem. The essay begins with alcohol, then in the next paragraph jumps to the last stanza of the poem where religion is referenced. I would have liked to seen specific quotes (whole lines), explaining the writer&rsquo;s thesis about nature, alcohol, and industrialization.5 Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? The paper does not specifically mention a shift in metaphor from liquor in stanza one to nature in summer in stanza two, to the change to nature in fall in stanza three, and finally the change in metaphor to a celestial setting in stanza four. The paper does relate the subjects of alcohol in stanza one to moral degradation, and Dickinson related nature is to religion in the following stanzas.Does the paper account for the way the poem&rsquo;s language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? No. The paper does not discuss how the image of drunkenness is illustrated in the &ldquo;reeling-thro-endless summer days&rdquo; or how the bees and butterflies flying from flower to flower, can be viewed as similar to staggering of a drunk person. The subject of the poem finally rests in the last stanza, the drunk subject has had her fill.

There is some use of quotations -- this could be more thorough. 
 
There appears to be only one reference to the use of dashes: the last one. 
 
There is some reference to form -- though this again could be better. 
 
I like the way the essay ends: it demonstrates a good understanding of the narrative being told through the poem. 
Good engagment with metaphor though the ideas here (i.e. molten blue) are good but remain under-explained.

I very much enjoyed reading this author's Bernadette Mayer experiment.  The author clearly detailed their process and did a convincing close reading (""the method"" and ""the madness"").  I found the essay very interesting and engaging to read.
This assignment seemed to bring out a sense of fun and creativity that I don't recall seeing in the past assignments.   I think this author took a great creative leap with coming up with a poem by removing words.
Since the author hinted at wanting to hear readers' interpretation of this version of ""Incident"" here's mine: The speaker recalls a memory where they rode into town, full of hope and thoughts.  And they saw an unspecified happy incident and a beautiful view of Cape May from their vantage point.  The speaker's inarticulate words can be thought of a happy stutter, or recalling an incident from long ago, where the details are now fuzzy.  
I enjoyed this essay -- well done!

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
I appreciate your fine response to the essay assignment. Now it is time for me to do what I can to evaluate your essay using the rubric above. Though you did not explicitly touch on condensation, grammar, prepositions, or subjectivity (#1-4), yours is the only essay of the four assigned to me that discussed tradition (#5) at all -- great job! You state: ""This piece completely destroys the 'Madonna' maternal image."" And then you back up your statement. I especially enjoyed your insight about how thoughts are gathered. You write that ""in Version 2 the thoughts are broken between stanzas causing you to slow down the tempo."" I hadn't realized that occurred until you brought it to my attention. Thank you for that insight!

Perhaps it is best to start by going over the points of the imagist manifesto one by one and indicate how version 2 is somewhat more in conformance (if indeed). Towards the end, it might be possible to come up with a more general statement integrating the observations.

Common speech, exact words - a significant omission from the second version is the description of the child being a &ldquo;thief&rdquo; of sorts robbing his mother (of what - we are left to assume) - &ldquo;this little child / who robs her // knows nothing of / his theft&rdquo;. I find myself needing to quote &ldquo;thief&rdquo; - mainly because this is not the exact usage for thievery &amp; robbing. In common speech one robs articles, possessions, items of tangible presence and value. The application of such an action to the emotional world is the very thing that the imagists are moving away from. So, by the removal of this metaphorical usage of robbing the second version is more of an imagist poem.
2. Free verse rather an conventional form - both versions employ a similar structure, a kind of a staccato of short verses. The poems can almost be read as one continues sentence and the breakage seem to be almost be arbitrary - so in this respect both version adhere to the manifesto. In closer reading of version 2 I find that the stanzas are somewhat interconnected to each other by way of a form of linkage or continuation, with the second line of each stanza linked to the first line of the next (tears on her cheek, her cheek on her hand, the child in her lap, his nose pressed). So this is a play in form - the stanza breaks are playing against the content of the poem. This might count as a more imagist use of the language - going against the grain - against conventional form. This might also be an expression of the tension between the mother and child using the form and stanza breaks rather then content.
3. Absolute freedom in choice of subject - the subject of both poems seems to be young-women/little-child couplet. Knowing WCW, this is probably a suburban scene - a scene risen from the proximity of houses laid against the communal distance between residences. With the removal of the robbing metaphor, the second version is a bit more &ldquo;flat&rdquo; in its subject - merely descriptive of the couple and not touching on their emotional interaction. Still, I find the two versions comparable in their conformity.
4. To present an image - The first version, starts out with a &ldquo;while&rdquo; clause, continues with a descriptive body and ends with a &ldquo;but&rdquo; ending/conclusion. It does not paint a picture but rather describes the dynamics of a situation. The woman, cheek, hand a child and there to setup and drive home the affect - a robbery is taking place in this quite suburban house. This is drama, not imagery. The second version does away with the &ldquo;while/but&rdquo; structure and removes the act of robbery - leaving the poem as a simple and clean description of an image - a set of objects (she, cheek, hand, child, lap, nose, glass) and prepositions (on her, in her, pressed to) to join them into a snapshot, a thing you will simply notice while you drive by the house.
5. Poetry which is hard and clear - a part from arguments provided before as to the enhanced clarity of version 2, one can also add the introduction of the glass material directly in the second version. Glass is a hard and yet clear material. It also has a role in other WCW poems - broken or as a barrier (between neighbors here).
6. Concentration - finally, the second version, shorted by the above mentioned omissions, is much more condensed, concentrated both in form (shorter) and content (the image itself rather then the emotional dynamics).
The summarize, the second version is a more of an imagist poem, by way of conformance at least (if not be author intent).

This is a very well written essay. There is no mention of the dashes, but everything else is fully covered. You did  a great job breaking down the stanzas and talking the feeling in each one. I love the thought of the angels coming to play with the drunkard. That is a very good take on the angels and one that I myself did not see when reading this poem.

While you say you feel ""slightly lost"" in the world of poetry, I appreciate how you used the reading to find your way through this poem which has so many possible meanings and pathways to understanding the images and shifting metaphors.  You stayed true to your experience and came out with some possible interpretations you many not have considered when you initially read the poem.

I hadn't considered a reference to fairies, and like how that plays with another possible meaning in her images.  

Overall, I recommend ""playing"" with the images more, maybe doing some free-associations with the images before settling down to plough through for a set meaning...  get a little inebriated with the poetry itself... the poems may just open up some more to you.

good work!    ",2

Bravo! The first essay I read that mentions every aspect of the poem - the use of dashes, form, feeling induced by both and ofcourse the different meanings the words and metaphors might have.
I like how the writer doesnt take ""one interpretation"" but gives us different takes and then even why one ""version"" is more valid than the other by method of elimination! Even certain sounds ('I' and 'ck') haven been takin into consideration, something, I must admit, that I have totally missed ^^
He/she even mentiones how there is a shift from summer to later when the angles shake their hats to release snow -&gt; arrival of winter. Good job!
If you want some ""nit-picking"" from me ^^ then MAYBE a bit more about the rhyme-sheme, if this poem could be considered a balad or not and a tiny bit more linking the actual words of Emily that represent/reflect your interpretation. But again, that nit-picking.
Very interesting read! Keep up the good work!
Well done.

It's not, as some would claim, lazy or plagiarizing, it's a very meaningful gesture calculated to simultaneously say something about the source text, expression, poetry and rhetoric generally. The gesture of the setup or the form communicates a frustration with conventional media reporting and rhetoric and provides an alternative writing method to counteract that tired method that isn't working anymore according to Jena. The poem created by the operation, bearing in mind the process, asks the reader to critically or close read language s/he wouldn't have otherwise, does a kind of re-contextualizing.",1

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
Well the writer is bit good to have the second form as the appreciable one and not quite interetsed to notice the first one. He brings the consideration of second one as the most sorted after for true explaination where the underlined story is baking a plot and not the one that is cooking no new issue for improvement in the lane. 
But the usage of words like""Silly and nonsense"" brings a kind of harsh mannerism to the close reading of the poem. Though, he has stated his own points but the way of providing the same seems bit tough.

Yes it will be part of the language of the relationship between husband and wife and may well be a poem also about Williams enjoying his wife as saved/prepared for him.  This is just to say...I love you/what you do and look what I can do with my craft and yours...here is a poem.  The response is acknowledgement and reminder of how much she contributes to his life and that whilst the plums were eaten that is much less a problem...the poetry and his satisfying his needs than the intrusion of his work at times.

Meantime, let me just say that on Tuesday I will suddenly have more time on my hands, and I will feel utterly bereft, and will begin to miss all my new ModPo friends (there are MANY of those).

That will keep me focused through the following Sunday. The shift of attention will be good, because otherwise I think I would be very low without our ModPo. We'll see how I handle the following week.

The essay speculates notes the four omitted words and the destablizing effect on form of their omission.  The poem does seem harsher due to the omission of the modifiers/qualifiers.  On a second read, the experiment appears to be advocating telling the truth in circuitous lies.  The essay therefore appropriately points out that the harshness of the experiemental version highlights Dickinson's attention to form and subtlety.  Her slant.

I enjoyed reading this essay. I imagined the essayist making the essay's points in a public performance with hand gestures. Very cool.
1. Condensation: The essay speaks of version 2 being more concentrated by the removal of vague and indefinite words and the issue of the thieving child being taken out.
2. Grammar: The essay makes a claim that version 2 begins with a composite sentence, and further word choice decisions make version 2 more in line with imagism's concern to use common speech and exacting precision.
3. Prepositions: Prepositions are not addressed.
4. Subjectivity: The speaker is not addressed.
5. Tradition: Tradition is not addressed.

The essay makes note of the way Dickinson has used the form of the poem to show a sense of cycle and seasonal time passing. The author has argued this with reference to the punctuation, language choice and form. The writer notes the dashes but could comment more on how they are employed by Dickinson in this poem to create meaning. The author discusses the possible outcome for the speaker for the poet but could expand further on their argument. Their isnt any mention of the original conceit and or shift in metaphor of this poem.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay of approximately 500 words.
 
&ldquo;Why I Am Not a Painter&rdquo; is a fabulous meta-poem that describes how liberating it feels to write.
Poetry is much more satisfying than painting, according to the last two stanzas. O&rsquo;Hara is a poet because poetry evokes life, while painting is just lines. Mike Goldberg starts his painting with the word &ldquo;SARDINES&rdquo; but when he is finished only letters are left, the word is obliterated, and the idea of SARDINES is gone. All Goldberg has at the end is &ldquo;just letters&rdquo;. Goldberg names his painting SARDINES, evoking the idea of pentimento, when earlier efforts show under layers of paint. In contrast to Goldberg&rsquo;s destruction, O&rsquo;Hara starts his poem thinking about the color orange and writes about life without ever mentioning orange. He starts with a line, but the poem needs more of life and because he is satisfied with the poem we infer that he has written about life. This is confirmed when the page fills up with &ldquo;words, not lines&rdquo;. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s words convey meaning; Goldberg&rsquo;s lines are just lines.
The New York School does not really have principles; their poems do not embody a philosophy other than exuberance. Instead they have a set of techniques, which are well exploited in this poem.
O&rsquo;Hara uses the New York School techniques of humor, irony, and friendship with painters to make fun of Goldberg without being offensive. O&rsquo;Hara has big doses of irony in his comparisons. Each artist starts with the other&rsquo;s basic building block, a word for the painter and a color for the poet. He and Goldberg both name their artworks after a missing word; SARDINES was present but was destroyed, and ORANGES was never present but is vibrant. It is ironic that the title that Goldberg chooses is a living animal but his painting is dead letters, but ORANGES is pigment and the poem is about life.
The New York School poets explore techniques of narrative experimentation, and, again, this poem embraces narrative exploration. The poem does not use pure narrative because it has the I-do-this-I-do-that quality and takes several readings to reveal action. This is heightened by the three uses of &ldquo;days go by&rdquo; to describe skips in the linear narrative flow. We don&rsquo;t know if Goldberg and O&rsquo;Hara worked at the same time, or even several years apart, and so the two stanzas may not be sequential. But it is somewhat narrative because the second and third stanzas each tell the story of creation of a piece of art from beginning to end. The &ldquo;I&ldquo; knows from the first line where the poem will end, mitigating the I-do-this-I-do-that effect. The ambiguous use of the pronouns is another New York School technique which is used here. In the second stanza, the &ldquo;it&rdquo; is always a painting and in the third the &ldquo;it&rdquo; is always a poem, but &ldquo;it&rdquo; unifies the poem by always referring to art.
Playing with the narrative form conveys the sense that O&rsquo;Hara is at the center of a creative tumult. Art is a competitive sport and O&rsquo;Hara wins.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
Hi
 
This was a very short essay. It would have been good to focus  on what the poem does. YOu seem to come to some very strong, clear concluisons about the nature of art. What part (if any) did the poem play in helping you come ot those conclusions? For example, what effect did the ""chatty"" style have on you? What about the way he slips in the terribleness of life at the end of a sentence?
YOu claim that both painting and poem are art and will remain art, and state that the creator has the right to name their creation. Did you see any humour in the poem? What about when he says ""I'm a real poet. I even write in prose.""? That made me laugh, because he didn't sem to be taking himself to seriously, even though his subject could be seen as quite serious.
YOu don't mention the ""I do this I do that"" style of the poem. What do you think it adds to the poem? Nor do you make any mention of ""metapoetry."" What does teh poem tell you about what it's like ot write poetry?
 
YOur fellow student,
 
[REDACTED]

Very amusing concluding sentence. I also interpreted the title as ironic, and the poem as expressing a number of similarities between painters and poets &ndash; in terms of artistic processes &ndash;so I don&rsquo;t think your essay is why you are not an essayist :) I think your essay could have been improved by a bit more of a discussion of how O&rsquo;Hara used structure, and possibly a bit more of an analysis of the New York School style. Overall good job.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
Condensation: The essay does note that version 2 is shorter than version 1. I really like the explanation of the stanza's, with the threads and wanting to read further! 
Grammar: The essay does note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions. Again with the threads and also with the words that were cut from the second version. 
Prepositions: The essay does note that the second version uses a great many prepositions and this is explained very well
Subjectivity: The essay doesnt really discuss the subjectivity
Tradition: The essay doesnt really discuss the symbolism in the poems

Nice essay, what I like mostly is fine language analysis. You give very interesting and detailed explanation of the word ""liquor"", its metaphor and lots of meanings, and ""tankards"" and many others. Stanzaic forms and rhymes are analysed effectively, but dashes are not mentioned. As regards main thesis, I think that it is too simple, that there are lots of senses in the poem, but I must say, that you follow your concept during the whole essay and prove it very well. Your essay could tell us more about the story of the lyrical character, here it seems too short.

The essay does an excellent job of explaining why Version 2 better reflects the Imagist programme. The major word changes are accounted for, and concision and precision are clearly shown. Some of the higher-level points suggested in the model evaluation guidelines are not present, but these were not clearly requested in the assignment. Good job, and that it was well-written made it a pleasure to read.

I really enjoyed your understanding of the poem; it's close to my own interpretation, but you picked out some details that I hadn't considered, so it broadened my own interpretation of the poem.
I especially liked your insight into who the landords and butterflies are: ""people who in one or more ways discourage others or themselves from seeing how wonderful life around them really is"" and ""people [who] will only occasionally see the wonder of life, for example when falling in love"". Nicely said. I struggled a bit with Dickinson's meaning, wondering what it meant that the bees were turned out by the landlords and the butterflies had renounced their dram and I think your interpretation fits perfectly with Dickinson's overall point in the poem. I also liked your idea that she is discussing the end of her life at the end of the poem. 
While you didn't discuss her use of dashes, I realize that the main idea of your essay didn't leave you a lot of room to analyze that in such a short essay assignment. I think you did a fair job of discussing the stanzaic form, as well as the story being told by Dickinson, in that you clearly outlined the progression of the poem, as well as commented on how she builds her case by increasing the extent and quality of her drinking (from the man-made world to nature to heaven itself). In this way, you also begin to deal with the purpose of her shifting metaphor.
Overall, well done. In such a short amount of time I think you provided a clear and partially detailed close reading of Dickinson's poem.

Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
1) condensation: This essay notes the use of superfluous words in version 1-- little, and there, for instance-- and their removal from version 2.
2) grammar, syntax: This essay notes the distracting effect of the structure of version 1, in which the opening phrase, beginning with ""while,"" creates a diversion to a ""parallel event,"" and ""introduces a temporal dimension,"" resulting in anti-Imagist vagueness. The writer also mentions how the subject of version 1, the child, moves in and out of focus in version 1.
3) prepositions: This essay does not discuss prepositions.
4) subjectivity: This essay asks whose subjectivity is voiced in the poem. and decides that it could be that of the poet or of the child. This essay takes the position that the poet's subjectivity intrudes excessively in version 1, and that version 2 leaves more room for the reader's own interpretations and subjectivity.
5) pictorial tradition: The art historical tradition of representations of the Madonna and Child is not discussed.
This essay pays close attention to the cadence of the poem, and compares meter to the brush strokes of a painted canvas. The writer proposes that the cadence of version 1 is more mechanical and less expressive than the variety of rhythms in version 2, in which ""every stanza has a new cadence."" ( I found this point interesting, but I read it the opposite way-- I thought version 2 was more monotonous, and that its monotony added to its impact. )

Good job! I enjoyed reading your poem and found the coincidences (""insane"", ""anti-art"") amusing as well. You talk about the relationship between your source material and the new mesostic and intepret it through that lense. Some advice that I got on my own mesostic that I think might apply here as well is to try reading your mesostic without that context in mind, to try and find a new interpretation unrelated to the source. 
But, great work! Hope you've enjoyed the class!

Here is a guide for assessing and commenting on essay #1 (close reading of Dickinsonâ€™s â€œI taste a liquor never brewedâ€). Please answer, at least briefly, all five sets of questions. Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? In other words, does the essay quote and/or in other ways account for the actual words used by poet? We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? Once youâ€™ve noted and remarked on whether the essay discusses these things, comment on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay does so.Does the paper say something about how Dickinsonâ€™s dashes works? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay deals with the dashes? Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly it discusses how the poemâ€™s form interacts with its content. For most essays that deal with this topic, the discussion will describe the way in which the speakerâ€™s figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble.Does the way the poem is written account for â€“ or befit â€“ the â€œstoryâ€ being told about the speaker? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay handles this issue.Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the paper account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
Extremely well crafted essay that demonstrates the wholeness of the poem in both content and form. The reference to the Bible in relation to Pearl and the note on the capitalization of words to show importance, demonstrates the metaphor of nature and God as the essayist here wrote.  The theme of authority versus openness is carefully constructed in the essay and reinforced by the discussion of the dash to signal an eternity that cannot be captured.
The presentation of the essay shows how each stanza moves and ambulates in a drunken way, to and from, swaying from the power and its limitlessness, yet still aware of the struggle between man and nature, as is the struggle of beast with nature.
The paper addresses the metaphoric language employed by Dickinson to show the transient nature of of man's intoxication, and in some ways, intoxication of man with nature, as man questions God, and is turned out by God, and struggles with God and God's plan. If God turns man out of the garden, then man must find a way to capture that essence. The essay invokes that with the discussion of the inn as sky and inn as flower. Man can plant flowers, hence, man can ""capture"" the essence of God, but man can't create the sky, although will try to conquere it.

I find your approach to the assignment delightful. An aspirin bottle?  What a novel choice.  Completely in the spirit of the poets we've studied this week.  And frightening?  Yes.  This poem reminds me of the TV ads of certain drugs which contain warnings of possibile side effects that are chilling.  Love the ending--""3 or more alcoholic/drinks . . . "" (what you must take to cope with the product) and your idea that scientific research is really putting us in a cage. Very good!

Essay
So Much Depends Upon&hellip; Profound Interiority
Essay by [REDACTED] for Coursera / Modern and Contemporary American Poetry; Assignment 2; 10/7/2012
The deft imagist poet carries the reader into the personal intimate inner world by using sparing expression and precise penetrating visual clarity. Shunning ornamentation and showy emotionality, the imagist uses dry concision and exact simplicity to reveal and enshrine that inner world, causing its subtle potent landscapes to emerge in direct familiar emotional tangibility. In doing so, the imagist conveys the reader from word and page to a direct experience of the self in a manner fundamentally real and affirming: From exercise in poetics to depth of interiority, and at best into profound interiority.
William Carlos Williams&rsquo; created two versions of the poem, ""Young Woman at a Window"", one sent into the world via publication, the other bedded safely away in a store of personal papers, his intention for it unknown. Of the two versions, the second is most true to the imagist manifesto.
Both versions frame a single moment; A young woman sits with tears on her cheek. Both speak in spare free verse. Both convey gentle longing or sorrow without explicitly revealing source or cause. Both brief, relying on repetition of simple words and phrases in simple irregular cadence.
Beyond these common traits, there are clear differences. The first, the published version, is more complex. It uses more words, some unnecessary, to convey meaning. Unfortunately, these occasionally distract us from the core emotional pull of the base imagery. The first word &ldquo;while&rdquo; is used to tell that something is happening concurrent with her sitting. We do not need to be told. The first stanza of version 1 ends without the emotional anchor of &ldquo;tears&rdquo;, so expertly introduced straightaway in version 2 with the direct thrust of the first phrase &ldquo;she sits with tears&rdquo;. &ldquo;Her cheek on her hand&rdquo; and effective image of frozen in thought&hellip;or feeling&rdquo;, perhaps pensive or forlorn used in both versions.
Version 1 then proceeds to introduce the complexity and distraction of the &ldquo;child who robs her&rdquo; and the &ldquo;theft&rdquo; it &ldquo;knows nothing of&rdquo;. The image of theft or robbery may set up drama or perhaps a stunning and resonant image, but it takes us quickly away from the place where we already stand within the interior life of our young woman. The &ldquo;theft&rdquo; the child &ldquo;knows nothing of&rdquo; injects unnecessary generality and vagueness. Even worse, the vagueness is somewhat mysterious and compelling, inviting analytic thought, and therefore further undermining the imagists resolve to render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities. Additionally, the phrase &ldquo;this little child who robs her&rdquo; is somewhat ornamental, decorative without meaningful substance. (Of course we now know her sadness is from loss of youthful freedom and the carefree life, but this adds very little to our interior experience. It&rsquo;s essentially a wasteful image. The same is true of the image of the child rubbing his nose. This is an ornament that conveys detachment or innocence, but unnecessarily. We do not need this to deepen our passion for our young woman.
The imagery of second version is more concise, compact and compelling. It takes us home to interior meaning and affect quickly, and holds us there. It cradles us in deep interiority by letting us rest with the simple single image of &ldquo;she sits with tears&rdquo;. The image is direct, pointed, clear, and simple. The role of the child is simply to be present. He does not command our attention, but his presence gently and powerfully warms and accompanies our inner empathy with her tears of sadness.
Finally &ldquo;the glass&rdquo;: The child presses his nose &ldquo;to the glass&rdquo;. We now know that our young woman looks out&hellip;or in. Is the glass a window or a mirror? With our young woman do we look out, to a world that she cannot access, that has hurt her, that calls to her? Or do we look within, to her heart, her longing, to her hurt? The true power of the image of the glass is that it does not require a reason or explanation as to why she looks. We have the essentials: She sits. She sheds tears. She looks. When the question ""Why does she look?"" arises in the mind the reader is already well within the deep interior of the self. The simple economy of imagery of the second version has carried the reader to profound interiority&hellip;.uncluttered emotion&hellip; where we rest and savor. Just as the adept imagist would have us do.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
You do speak a lot about the formal elements and provide some analytical background on how O'Hara's poem is like the elements of the painters that he was associating with at that time.  You do have a mention of the poem called ""Oranges"" and the painting called ""Sardines"" but I would like to have heard more about what you think the differences and / or similiarities are about them.
Your point of ""saying I am a real poet"" is right on as far as how O'Hara felt meta-poetically.  It is a poem about writing poetry as it is influenced by abstract art.  That was good.  I do like your conclusion that ""he may bring all forms of art into the writing"" - I don't know if you meant this to mean art as paint on canvas but it made me think all forms of art: music, sculpture, architecture, dance etc ... that infomed these guys about new things to do in the media that they chose to work within (not to mention guys like Cage who would work in multiple media).  This was all very liberating and we enjoy that liberation ourselves today.

Thoughtful and well-researched essay.  The essay takes Dickinson's poems and breaks down the most important metaphors.  I particularly enjoyed this person's reading of each stanza as working from the ground up to reach a sense of enlightenment or rapture in the natural realm.  The writer addresses Dickinson's use of dashes as a device used to open the poem to the reader and at the same time make the reader pause at certain points.  The writer highlights each stanza as an individual image in Dickinson's mind which equates to her heightened euphoria in nature.  This was truly an interesting read.  The writer covers all of the points in the essay prompt with thought and precision.

The writer of the essay does go beyond the what, to the how - for example, speaking in the first paragraph of how he or she thinks it is clear that the poet is speaking of life experiences she is just discovering.
The writer notes the last dash; and suggests that this device 'is hinting toward the fact, again, that she will never stop drinking the liquor or breathing the air.'
The essay does touch upon the story, unfolding it as a sequence of events.

As regards the general metaphor of the poem, I think it was quite understood and very well explained. I myself share the same interpretation of the poem, and you've opened my mind to some lines that where a bit confusing and now after reading your essay I perfectly agree with you. 
The only ""critic"" I can make is about the form of the poem ""helps"" to the whole interpretation of it. I think rhyme and rhythm are very important here, as much as the metaphor does. It was no clear mention to these particular resourses. But on the other side, as I said, I think it was well explained the ""how"" the poet tells the story and comunicates the idea she wants us to get. 
I very much liked this interpretation!

Essay
The cadence of the second poem -- over the first -- is more conversational; the words have a natural rhythm that describes the essence of imagism -- a simply stated scene that we can ponder and consider as we probe for a meaning if we want to find a ""meaning."" The second poem with its spare language allows a look at feelings we might conjure, now or later. The first version doesn't have that spareness because of its complicated wording. 
The first version forces us to untangle descriptive words -- ""robs her,"" ""knows nothing,"" ""his theft."" We are left with unanswered questions and certainly uncertain answers. 
More so than the first, the second, with its spare active voice, uses forceful words to depict and describe the scene of a woman distressed, or happy, and yet she holds a child who symbolically looks out to the outside world of hope or possibly even despair. We have a choice with the second; the first asks us to ponder. 
Unlike the first, the second poem wants us to image the starkness of the scene. Why is the woman sad, or is she crying with tears of joy? The child is juxtaposed between tears of sadness or happiness with his/her nose to the glass; the choice is ours.
The nose pressed to the glass could anticipate the arrival of a father/lover who is leaving or coming home; again the emotion of the second version's words allows us to imagine the scene simply. We can then turn to our emotional response(s). 
The first poem with its descriptive and unresolved words only clouds; the spareness of the second illuminates on a personal level.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Emily Dickinson's poem starts with the ""I"" &mdash; and if we think, like the discussion video group, that Emily the Poet is speaking in ""I dwell in Possibility,"" then I would like to assume she speaks in ""I taste a liquor never brewed.""
When read that way, the poem takes us through the highs and lows of being and thinking like a poet, in relation to the highs and lows of the drinker, probably drunkard: Poetry, like alcohol, as stiumulant and depressant. Drunkards drink alcohol, while poets ""drink in"" the world around them.
Dickinson is at play right from the beginning. Liquor is distilled, not brewed. Yet a ""Tankard"" is a tall mug of beer &mdash; which is brewed &mdash; and her ""Vats upon the Rhine"" signify Germany, land of the beer.
Now, in our second stanza, Dickinson is drunk with ""air"" and indulging in ""dew."" These are natural terms and signify outside &mdash; maybe gardens? &mdash; and the morning.
Cooped up in her home, as the author was, the ""Reeling &mdash; thro' endless summer days &mdash;"" invites a feeling of stuffiness of being inside that the morning would help alleviate.
Molten blue signifies an intense sadness, and double meaning of flowing water or, possibly ice, because of the connection with molten lava. Molten means melted. An endless summer day could certainly do some melting. And using the term ""inn"" connects the stanza with the next, which I find particularly strong in its connections to bars, pubs, etc.
I've thought about why the terms ""Landlords"" and ""drams"" are used in quotations in the poem and cannot develop a good answer. But this metaphor works in our ""nature and garden"" theme used above, as well as the reality of bars for regulars &mdash; which I find personally palpable.
A ""drunken Bee"" can be any one of a bar's regular customers who sit and talk and create that general buzz that one experiences at a bar &mdash; a town bar &mdash; in the evening. And what a wonderful name for a town bar &mdash; ""the Foxglove,"" which of course is also a pastel flower that bees would actually pollinate. A flower's door would be where a bee would enter.
""Butterflies,"" a term that doubles as a frivolous person &mdash; like social butterfly &mdash; take a ""dram,"" or small amount of nectar in the same way a bar patron would take a small amount of liquor in a shot glass.
There is a limit to how much someone can drink in any given sitting, yet for the poet, who is drinking in life around her: ""I shall but drink the more!"" Is there a limit for poets? Maybe for some, but not for Dickinson.
In the final stanza Dickinson does not use the word ""I,"" but it seems ""the little Tippler"" is a reference to her. As in ""The spreading wide my narrow Hands/To gather Paradise &mdash;"" here we have a small poet, who is high &mdash; a word with a double meaning related to alcohol &mdash; in the sky by the sun.
The last stanza seems to have a meaning I cannot quite reach. Perhaps Dickinson was aware that others who were less talented to her received much more attention. That had to bother her. The people in her home, like her sister, had no idea of her genius. Was that difficult? She is taking her clearly small, unnoticed stature (at home) and casting it large over all eternity (in Paradise watched and cheered by seraphs and saints).

We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? Once youâ€™ve noted and remarked on whether the essay discusses these things, comment on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay does so.Does the paper say something about how Dickinsonâ€™s dashes works? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay deals with the dashes? Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly it discusses how the poemâ€™s form interacts with its content. For most essays that deal with this topic, the discussion will describe the way in which the speakerâ€™s figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble.Does the way the poem is written account for â€“ or befit â€“ the â€œstoryâ€ being told about the speaker? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay handles this issue.Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the paper account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
This essay quotes generously from the poem, and the quotes are incorporated seamlessly to illustrate and expand the essayist's account of the poem.  By characterizing the dashes as ""hiccups"" and accounting for the ""slant"" form of the poem as reflexive of its theme, the essayist does a very good job of close reading for a ""story"" of the poem that hews closely to the way the poem is written.  The essay also provides a key to several of the poem's metaphors, citing two possible interpretations of the seraphs' ""snowy hats"".

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Brewing is a process of corruption. Bacteria consumes sugar and then die in their own waste which is forms alcohol. Dickinson is imbibing something uncorrupt from a vessel that is hollowed out from pearl, a natural precious substance caused by an irritation over time. This is not an earthy drink, it doesn't come from the best drink on earth (vats upon the Rhine) which would be a German beer, but from somewhere else.
This is a drink made from air and dew. She is drunk from the sky. The air in invisible. The dew comes from the air and appears miraculously in the morning as if from the sky, which is molten blue. The hot sky of summer. Subsequent stanzas imply we are moving through the seasons, through time.
The world landlord is in scare quotes [1]. Research tells that this term was not used until after the 19th century. However, one can infer that it still meant that the author is implying that there is some irony in the word landlords. No human is really lord over the land. Possibly it is the distant future when bees are turned out of the flowers.
To turn a drunken bee out of the foxglove's door is to deny the bee it sustenance and also it's pleasure. Foxglove is also called digitalis and so has a medicinal connotation. It is used as a palliative for the heart. The entomoloy of the flowers name is obscure, but a 19th century source suggests Foxglove [2] is said to be the place where faeries reside.
Dickinson might be likening the bee to a Faerie. More obscurely, Foxglove is said to come from the word ""foxes'glew"" which is another name for music or instrument. This is discounted at the source, but the flower is also bell shaped. Dickinson is using this ""swarm"" of associations to imply a connection to sound and magic and back to the bee, which is small, as is she.
The butterfly renounces it's drams. Drams is a word meaning weight and volume, but obscurely it means a very small amount of liqueur. In this stanza taken together Dickinson is implying that the time of the poem is speeding into a far future. The end of nature, eternity. Where those who are immortal meet.
A Seraph [3] is a fire angel residing around the throne of the deity. To say that a Seraph would swing a snowy hat implies that the snow is cold indeed. It's possible that this is from Dante and inverts the angel into a demon in the last circle of hell, which is near absolute zero, so far it is away from god. Even the saint is called away from their devotions to see Dickinson is a little tippler leaning against the sun, still warm though the fire angels are topped with snow.
In short the poet apprehends an uncorrupted nature in all it's wholeness over time. She leans against the centrality of the system of planets, long in the future, seen from an eternal perspective. The irritating things of life cause the cup, in which a marvelous intoxicant. made of invisible elements, gathers over time. Higher beings recognize this other being as marvelous and as indestructible as a being who is becoming can be.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay of approximately 500 words.
To be quite honest, I found it very difficult to understand the central argument of the poem, that is, why O'Hara is a poet and not a painter. What I see in the poem, on the contrary, is a paralelism between painting and writing. I haven't really found any strong argument to support the idea that the title of the poem suggests.I think he is making a comparison, a paralelism, between the different approaches in the process of creating a work of art in painting and writing. In a way he is showing us the transformation and the different ""steps"" that the artist faces when creating art. I see this in the fact that he at first sees the sardines in Mike's painting, which are then kind of ""lost"" in the process, and, in the same way, how the original idea of his poem (the orange color) then is also lost in the complex process of producing and signifying art, to the point that when both works are finished, one could barely understand the main idea or concept of the work, which is emphasized by the fact that the title of the work refers to this ""original idea"" which was ""lost"" in the way or transformed into several other things, making the reader or viewer of the work being lost or confused.
One possible way in which he prefers poetry than painting, is maybe the conceptual possibilities of writing, that is inevitable full of meaning (""There should be so much more, not of orange, of words, of how terrible orange is and life.""), and the way in which the poet can describle a specific thing without even mention it at all.
The New York School principles and idea are developed in the poem in the fact that the poem is very individual. It's always ""I"". The poet explains a ""universal issue"" (creating and signifying art) thorugh a personal experience, always in a self-referential way. Also we can see the I-do-this I-do-that style all over the poem, mixing actual historical expericences (such as droping in Mike Goldberg's art shop) with non-temporal ideas or working experiences (such as the creation of a poem or set of poems).

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
A short and convincing essay which accounts for mostly all aspects of the poems discussed.The scaffolding is a well-chosen term and accurately describes the unfolding images that compose the text. It is to be noted the mention of the prepositional ""engine"" that create the image frame by frame as well as the idea of taking the potential viewer/writer=poet into account as being a witness. I therefore consider the essay a successful one that covers most of the important points which should be considered when reading William's versions of ""the Woman..."". Good job and congratulations!

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
This essayist is satirizing the New York poet by writing a New York style poem about New York style art. 
I found myself laughing out loud, and explaining the poem on the phone to a writer friend who just called me this morning to borrow my car.
He exhibits rather than explains the New York style, and it works very well, in my opinion, exhibiting that the essayist grasps everything about that style to the point of replicating it.  He so intergrates it into the discussion, that he does it and satirizes the I do this, I do that, and the competative cross fertilization of the poet and painter.
My friend reminded me on the phone that all true art is spiritual, because it comes from a unformed source which is inspiration, but really who knows what that is.  The essayist captures that aspect of the creative force is his satire, as well. 
I think this a a job well done, to say the least.

Well done! :)  By taking the 'religious' theme of the poem as your main conceit and following it clean through your essay, you have caught all the necessary attributes of this assignment's requirements in your net flawlessly.  That you believe this poem to be religious intrigues me.  I myself saw the poem as a progression to the spiritual, from 'man' (first stanza) to 'Nature' (second and third stanza) to finally 'Heaven' (last stanza), that to reach the spiritual one must first transcend man and Nature, that is to be ONE with the -- Sun -- her inspiration, her poems.  Enough about what I think! :)  I wish I could write more about what you wrote, but I find nothing glaringly distracting.  It is only good that I see. :)

Painting and poetry were compared. The discussion of ""icons"" is very interesting.
The essay indirectly tackled the I-do-this-I-do-that style.
There was no discussion of meta-poetry, but instead, the essay shows that the omission of the word 'oranges' was intentional.
Overall, I think it is a nice essay. Great effort! :)

The essay does an excellent job of interpreting Dickinson's metaphors and motifs. I particularly liked the suggestion that Dickinson was poking fun at herself and that the poem could be showing support for the temperance movement; this was something that hadn't occurred to me. It also remarks on her use of dashes throughout the poem to echo the staggering or reeling motion of the poem's inebriated author and to lend emphasis to certain words, like ""Sun.""

My Creative Experiment
I opted for Option B: Bernadette Mayer Experiment. Actually it is a combination of a few ideas in Mayer's list of experiments. I took a famous line from William Shakespeare's Macbeth and a list of the names of perfumes and mixed the words from the line with the names of perfumes to achieve a result. The line I took is from the sleep-walking scene and the words are uttered by Lady Macbeth.
I chose some twenty five somewhat dark names of perfumes that seemed relevant in the context of the play, and narrowed my list to eleven to match the number of words in the line chosen. I arranged the names of perfumes vertically in alphabetical order and I put a word each of Lady Macbeth, in vertical order, against a perfume. What emerged in the end surprised me because it seemed to have acquired a few meanings. I tried several ways of arranging words, but finally settled for this one. I chose the title Red &amp; Black for two reasons: a) the colors symbolize blood and night that dominate the play Macbeth; b) the colors are the names of two perfumes mentioned in the poem. 
I&rsquo;d be very glad to hear what you thought when you first read my &lsquo;poem&rsquo;.

The point has been made that she is 'elitist'. Well I have my objections to that term being used as much as our trying to interpret her from a 20th C. feminist stand point.

This essay discusses and explains the poem more than adequately. The first paragraph is solid and deals with the speaker's intoxication commendably. The second paragraph deals with the subject of illusion and false reality, whilst I would not question the validity of the argument - its link to the poem is rather tenuous; the author asserts that the subjective experience of the speaker is false yet includes no reference to the text to support this claim. I do feel the argument is on the right track but simply over-extends itself. I think the reader can certainly feel a sense of doubt and unease over the veracity of the speaker's account; however, there does not seem to be enough evidence to render it false. Too much depends upon the author's own experience with alcohol. The Whitman reference is unneccesary.
The essay does not comment upon the use of dashes.
The essay does not comment upon the stanzaic form.
The essay does deal with the story of the poem. The speaker's journey is clearly plotted out within the essay.
The essay does deal with the shifts in metaphor. The author certainly notices shifts in metaphor, explaining when the speaker's experiences align with certain metaphors and when these metaphors become inadequate.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Dickinson uses the contrast between the motif of humanity and the imagery of nature with the transition through the seasons in her structure to show how man is never satisfied with what he has. The author uses the persona to show this through the way she always hopes for the wine when it isn&rsquo;t there and abuses it when it is.
Each of the stanzas in the poem depict a different season. Each of these seasons describe the persona being unhappy and hoping for the next. This is shown through the imagery used by the author as well as how she is described. Beginning with Spring in the first stanza and until winter in the last, we see the persona always longing for what the next season of the year will bring.
The first stanza paints a picture of spring through the use of nature imagery as well as a play of words in the title. It seems like the persona is anticipating the summer by already &lsquo;tasting the liquor&rsquo; that has not yet been brewed. It seems like she is imagining the exquisite taste of the liquor that is to be made after it was harvested in the summer. This is reinforced by the persona saying &lsquo;Not all the Vats upon the Rhine / Yield such an Alcohol&rdquo; where she shows that this liquor that she will have is richer and more tasteful than the best there is since the valleys of the Rhine is where the best wine come from.
Secondly, these lines and the paradox in both the title and the first line hints at the purity of this liquor coming only from nature. Since brewing is the process to make liquor, how could it exist if it wasn&rsquo;t brewed? Tying this to the idea that brewing is a human action and the spattering of nature imagery and allusions to the heavens in the poem, perhaps the author is telling us that this liquor comes entirely from nature. This makes its purity and perfection a contrast to the persona, exhibiting human traits and reacting to the effects of this liquor.
The second stanza portrays the persona as a drunkard just staggering through the moment she waited for all through spring. The words &ldquo;Inebriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Debauchee&rdquo;, despite giving a sense of indulgence show that the persona does not really enjoy her liquor. The line &ldquo;reeling -- thro endless summer days&rdquo; does not only show that it is summer and the time for harvest but also that she has succumbed to a certain stupor brought about by this liquor.It may be because the persona has not have enough of this liquor portrayed through her &ldquo;breathing in the air&rdquo; and &ldquo;dew&rdquo; and in the last line of the third stanza where she &ldquo;shall but drink more&rdquo;. These lead us to the conclusion that the persona is hooked on her drink and her life becomes one that just hopes to drink more.
Autumn, shown by the bee, a symbolism of summer, leaving the foxglove which is a flower that blooms in the fall. At the same time, this contrast of summer and autumn also alludes to something graver that happens to the persona. Summer is associated with bliss and freedom but autumn however is a graver season because it is here that one prepares for the upcoming winter. In the poem, this alludes to how the persona transitions from being blissful in the summer to developing health problems and getting poisoned in the autumn as symbolized by the poisonous Foxglove. The last line of the stanza &ldquo;I shall but drink more!&rdquo; serves to show that the persona has become addicted to the liquor, and to an extent, nature. At the same time, the line serves as a resolution that the reader will drink until all nature will be finished, and this is when winter comes along.
The last stanza is all about the fate of our Debauchee and her hopes for the next year. Winter is the last season of the year and it is the last stage in the persona&rsquo;s transition. It also concludes the author&rsquo;s message. Here we see the persona completing her transformation becoming a &ldquo;little Tippler&rdquo;. She is now completely hooked to the products of nature, yet at the same time has no liquor anymore to consume. This is seen through imagery of the last line of the poem &ldquo;Leaning against the -- Sun --&rdquo;. Leaning, in the context of the poem shows her drunk and perhaps hungover. Because of her staggering through the seasons, she ends up looking for support and ironically finds the &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; which is a symbolism hope and a new life. The imageries here and in the poem build to the conclusion that despite the abuse of nature represented by the liquor and the effect it has on us, eventually, we still will turn to it for a new beginning. This is the characteristic of the purity of nature, to be always there for man and it becomes the characteristic of the flaws of man to never be satisfied with what nature gives. All these is tied through the seasons, first on how spring is the time of new hope until winter the time of death, waiting again for a new beginning.

I think that in a very brief essay, you achieve a great deal. I love the opening quote, although I am not quite sure of how this is used as a means to state that the ' ""I"" in the poem is not a person, but a soul.' If it were expanded upon, the relationship might be more clear. Despite this, I think there is definitely something in the statement that the poem is about a soul. I think this could be further explored. I like that you take the conceit of liquor and create the imagery of a brewery using Air, Dew and Molten Blue. This is an interesting perspective on Dickinson's use of these words, but again, there is so much to this poem, that conceit could be explored a little more in depth. 
It is interesting that you pay special attention to the Foxglove and its use in making a drug. That, I'm sure, is a little known fact, and I love how you relate it to physical frailty. Maybe this frailty could also be further explored as well, especially in relation to the rest of the poem. Why would Dickinson be talking about physical frailty amidst this poem that seems to be teeming with joy (in the form of drunkenness)? This is definitely worth a deeper look.
The use of punctuation - the dashes and exclamation points - is completely ignored. I think that those are important aspects of the poem that could be very revealing. Also, the stanzaic form was neglected. Further examination of Dickinson's form in the poem could be interesting and give greater insight into this work.
In summary, as I first noted, this essay achieves a great deal, despite its brevity. I do believe, however, that many aspects of the poem were overlooked, and that it could be interesting to further explore some of the above elements, in order to gain a greater understanding of this poem.

If I had been indifferent to Stein, then it would have been a concern, but to be passionately negative is still a passionate reaction and should be accepted as such. I now list Stein is one of my favourite poets, but even if I did not, it would still be good... even great.In this particular case (Morris's work) there is an additional sensitivity, perhaps,Â because the poem speaks of / enactsÂ the deeply horrifying experiences of African Americans.

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
Dickinsonâ€™s poem â€œI taste a liquor never brewedâ€ is a
celebration of, even a reveling in, a state of ever increasing exhilaration that
leads to a peak experience.  The
extended metaphor is that of inebriation. 
The reader must figure out for himself the source of the inebriation,
which is at first presented as a puzzle: how can there be a liquor that is
never brewed? 

 The intoxicant is described as air and dew.  Man can not create either air or dew
but they are always present.  We
are led to think of the natural world as the stimulant, with some support from
additional nature imagery later in the poem: bee, foxglove, butterfly,
sun.  Air and dew (water) are the
stuff of life. The mere acts of breathing and drinking, of just living, is a state of wonder that is being compared to a chemical high.

 

Dickinsonâ€™s poem would lack interest had it merely listed
some nature imagery.  But there is a
progression of steadily building intensity in the poem. Each stanza, clearly
marked by line division and a traditional (as in ""Mary Had a Little Lamb""  ABCB rhyme pattern, brings the reader one more
step along the path of the poet. 
The first stanza begins with just a taste, by the second the poet has
reached inebriation and debauch. By the third stanza she has gone beyond the
lower pleasures of animals into a distinctly human and possibly dangerous
realm. The stanzas also progress through the year. The second
stanza is summer, and the third is the time that butterflies leave, the autumn.
With this in mind, we can look back to stanza 1 and see the spring showers in
the pearly clouds. 

 

We may think we are prepared for the final stanza, which logically should represent winter and death.  The
poem does connect with winter, via the snowy hats, but there is a surprise in
store. The poet does not die; the poet moves beyond death. She sees the  saints and seraphs and even passes them
by.  She is no drunkard who leans
on a lamppost on the way down. She reaches the source of all life, the Sun, and actually touches it.  The use of the final dash is
brilliant.  It sets the Sun apart
from the rest of the poem as a self-sufficient entity that exists on its own without verb. We might even take a
Christian reading of the poem and see it as a portrayal of the trajectory of
life leading to the Son of God. The fever pitch is communicated to the reader, who shares the poet's culminating peak experience.

        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.

The essay's author states that ""this is the hardest analysis we have been given, of Dickinsonâ€™s poems.  This is because I do not see as many multiple readings as in some of the others."" This goes to show a lack of understanding of ED poetry and the artistic period in which the poem was writte. The essay continues in a dubvitative way, giving 2 faced opinions. This does'nt answer the recuired 4 points and comprehension.

1. The student does quote Dickinson and explains thoroughly the quotes he/she choose. He/she effectively coveys the how of the poem by explaining different possibilities to what the poem is about, he/she gives their stand on what Dickinson could possibly mean when she wrote this essay. The essay does this by making references to words that are in the poem, for example ""(We can assume by the reference to the Rhine, a river that runs through much of Europe, including France, that she means to include wine, although wine is fermented, not brewed.)"" The essay gives a convincing explanation and makes you understand what the author was really trying to convey through her poem.
2. He/she does address the punctuation of the poem although there is just one sentence pertaining to the punctuation, it is sufficient enough for us to understand why the poem is punctuated like that.
3. Yes the author of essay does address the structure of the poem, in each paragraph he/she addresses a specific stanza. The essay speaks of the author's drunkenness and the possible explanations of why she might be drunk on the poetry.
4. The essay doesn't address why the author decides not to stick to the metaphor of the tavern, the essay does address the way the language of the poem changes throughout the poem and how by the progress of the poem the author seems to get more sophisticated, she first started with beer and she continues to fine wine. The essay addresses all the points correctly and analyzes most of the poem, and provides with explanations.

The writer does a good job of explaining the essence of the poem, and covers the major thought points in sequence from stanza to stanza. The interpretation of imagery of ""Molten Blue"" and the ""Tavern"" to that of laying in the summer grass lost in the beauty of the moment is a good one, as is the writer's suggestion that Dickinson is experiencing a complete awareness of surrounding, and as natural extension to that of the inner-self.  The writer also makes an interesting comment on the angels and saints approval of her head-over-heels ""intoxication"" of nature, and as an extension of that, that this may be the only such inebriation to meet with their acceptance.
The essay would have been more well-rounded if the writer had commented on either form and function, punctuation, or progression, but overall it is an effective and well written analysis.

I really enjoyed reading this well-structured and carefully written essay. After a week of viewing so many submissions, I have a better sense of what we were all instructed to do, and I feel you followed the guidelines quite skillfully. 
I especially admire the way you examined the poem, and then presented the notion that Dickinson is making an argument for the poet's view, the poet's life of examining nature closely. Your claim, ""all poets can (likely) agree on the fact that they see life differently: with more heightened emotion, in more vibrant color, perhaps even grittier than it truly is"" might read as an imposition of your own thoughts on Dickison's poem, but it works because you back it up with your next sentence:
 ""In ""I taste a liquor never brewed, "" Dickinson conveys this same kind of heightened experience.""
Great work on going through the poem methodically â€”Â and then you did a lovely job of wrapping it all up, tying the end back to your original claim. Thoroughly enjoyable and worth reading.

Thank you for introducing me to this Maya Angelou poem ""Still I Rise.""  It is an indictment, a challenge, and an homage to the invincible spirit of an oppressed people.   The Bernadette Mayer experiment that you conducted eliminated the word ""you may"" and ""you."" with interesting results.    ""You may"" is a form of speech that politely challenges the truth of a statement.   By removing the ""you may"" the lines become more declarative and imperative.   The inclusion of ""you may"" emphasizes the fact that whatever you think it doesn't make it true.   However, the elimination of the word ""you"" did not lead to a greater emphasis or understanding of the poem.   But I did go one step further and delete the possessive plural of ""you"" which is ""Your"" as well as all personal pronouns - including ""I"", ""me""   and ""my"".   Strangely, the elimination of all personal pronouns provides a sense of a larger community of both the living and the dead.    Whatever you do to this poem cannot change the impact of the word ""rise""  as a gospel hymn.

This was such a well written essay! Not only did you touch on the meanings of why Dickinson uses certain dashes and grammar, but you were clear on the meaning of the metaphors and the poem in general. Your poem was very easy to understand and I would say you followed the directions very well! 

When I first pictured Emily Dickinson I thought of a girl who sits in her room 24/7, never comes out, and is always just writing poems. After reading this poem I kind of got a different feeling. Did you? 

Any ways, this was a great essay. Great job!

First, both versions of this poem might be categorized as imagist. Â Each is in free verse, uses vernacular language and concentrates on conveying a hard image - that of a mother who is crying while holding her baby in her lap. Â In both cases Williams seems to select his subject the way a photographer might, converting a moment's observation into a fixed image for the reader (viewer.) Â Of course there is a major difference between the two versions: version one tells a story and version two does not. Â Version one pivots on an explicit irony: the source of a mother's weary tears is the baby in her lap, who has robbed her - of her youth? her energy? her life? - and who is obliviously rubbing his nose while his mother cries. Â The picture is clear, but clearly contains narrative elements selected to convey a specific story of mother's (hopefully) momentary despair. Â Version two is stripped down, the irony gone, the story almost completely effaced. Â What the reader gets is a picture, an image, that is so static and hard-edged that it only barely suggests the mother's sadness and the baby's responsibility for that sadness. Â  The result is the poetic equivalent of erecting a statue. Â In place of the homely details of version one, we get a picture so stark and severe that it suggests not the specific details of something Dr. Williams observed but a sort of timeless image of maternal resignation. Â Â Both of these versions of the poem are beautiful. Â But which is the most ""Imagist?"" Â Well, the fourth element of the Imagist manifesto is, ""To Present an Image."" Â Version two is nothing but an image. Â So...

TEXT OF ESSAY GOES HERE. Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form. This is where the text of your essay goes.
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â While Iâ€™m
sure â€œsuccess,â€ â€œeffectiveness,â€ and â€œfaithfulnessâ€ arenâ€™t necessarily intended
as three separate approaches from which to consider Williamsâ€™s â€œYoung Woman at
a Window,â€ Iâ€™d like to focus mostly on the poemâ€™s faithfulness to the tenets of
Imagism, and in doing so address to some degree what it would mean to be
faithful to any movement.Â  To be literal,
â€œfaithfulnessâ€ â€“ the state of having faith, belief, or hope in the validity or
efficacy of an ethic or approach to some aspect of life â€“ would, in respect to poetic
method, suggest that commitment to the approach lead to the creation of a poem
whose words, lines, stanzas, and expression would in turn (however applied in
the poemâ€™s form) engender apprehension of an idea or of a feeling,
comprehension of meaning, and the embodiment of an authorâ€™s vision and
experience of the world.Â  In the case of
Imagism, faith is specifically invested in concrete, specific, and sometimes
spare embodiments of the perceived world; and perhaps because of faith in the
power of these embodiments, the meaning of the perceived world will be vested
in the poem â€“ and, upon the poemâ€™s reading, translated to another.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The second
version of â€œYoung Woman at a Windowâ€ amounts to a far greater expression of
faith in Imagism than the first.Â  While
this faith is displayed in many ways throughout the poem, it is most obvious in
the matter of concentration on a single image, a criteria expressed overtly in
the sixth element of the â€œImagist manifesto.â€Â 
While the same two figures, the woman and child, inhabit both versions
of the poem, in the second version it is as if the two figures become one.Â  The separate identities of the woman and
child collapse into a single, representative image.Â  Individual motive disappears.Â  Time becomes an instant.Â  Williams creates this effect with the opening
line.Â  From the first versionâ€™s â€œWhile
she sits,â€ the second version reduces the line, eliminating chronological or
causative relation between the figures, and instead directly states â€œShe sits
with.â€Â  No longer are the two delineated
by time or by the actions of one distinguishable in time from those of the
other.Â  Through inclusion of the
preposition â€œwith,â€ their relationship becomes spatial, yet they are shown to
exist in the same space.Â  Therefore their
separate actions or means of expression â€“ â€œtears on/ her cheekâ€ . . . â€œnose
pressed/ to the glassâ€ are not independent, as we are given to think of the
actions of unique individuals, but extensions of one another.Â  

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This
cohesion effected in the second poem potentially suggests an interpretation
different from the first â€“ an occurrence caused by the narratorâ€™s diminished
role in the poem.Â  No longer are we told
that the child has robbed the woman or that he â€œknows nothing of/ his
theft.â€Â  As plain as such lines might be,
the faithful Imagist might view them as intrusions of the kind a â€œcosmic poetâ€
would make.Â  If one equates the cosmic
poet mentioned in the manifesto with a Whitman or those given to embellishment,
such insertions ought to be expunged.Â  In
Williamsâ€™s poetry, however, such lines could hardly be likened to those of a
â€œcosmic poet,â€ though they are the lines of one who knows the scene he looks
upon and then guides the reader with his words.Â 
Not only does he wish us to see as he sees, in version one, but heâ€™d
have us know as he knows.Â  Perhaps for
Williams the Imagist this is too much, for speaking as he does shows little
faith in his cause.Â  Simplicity alone
must carry truth, and the world as it is seen convey itself.Â  With authorial self-effacement,
interpretation â€“ and with it the world â€“ comes more into the realm of the
reader.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because a
faith in Imagism has governed the development of Williamsâ€™s second version of
â€œYoung Woman at the Window,â€ it becomes a successful and effective foray into
Imagist technique.Â  I ask myself whether
in doing so it has also become a separate poem.Â 
Change a word or line and no poem can be the same.Â  Yet has the poem lost the conflict between
woman and child implicit in version 1?Â 
Situational tension seems to have increased with the greater concision
of version 2.Â  With that, perhaps the
tension or cause of tension becomes more shared and symbiotic.Â  â€œ[H]er hand/ the childâ€ marks the midpoint of
the poem, yet does so unobtrusively, and without a prepositional relationship until
the next line.Â  Could child somehow be
womanâ€™s hand?Â  And then whose nose is
pressed to the glass?Â  To the faithful
Imagist does the world faithfully rendered defy interpretation?

This poem
written by Oâ€™Hara consists in a parable or an allegory about poetry and
painting. In this poem the author clearly expounds the differences between these
two arts; he points out the great importance of words in the art of poetry and
compares it to the equally great importance of ideas and visual elements in
painting.

The main
difference between these two arts is well described in the lines: Â ""There
should be/ so much more, not of orange, of/ words, of how terrible orange is/
and life."" Â Through these lines
the author is telling us that poetry can stimulates our thoughts thanks and
trough words, as painting is an art which is devoted to our sight.

When the
painter began to work on his painting, the author could see the letters of the
words SARDINES on the canvas but in the end the only reference to â€œsardinesâ€ can
be found in the title of the painting. Oâ€™Hara wants us to understand that
paintings are made of paint and visual element, not words what remains in the
end is a canvas picturing the painterâ€™s idea of sardines, his own
representation of it. At the opposite, poetry is made of words and not of visual
representations like colors; this is why the orange Oâ€™Hara has written about is
only present in the title of his work. 

In this poem
Oâ€™Hara explains the differences between poetry and painting but he definitely praises
both of these arts. This poem tells us that O Hara is not a painter because his
heart and soul are filled with words, and that he canâ€™t help using them.
Whatever he thinks about he always has thousand of words to describe and
explain his ideas to the world and this is why he is a poet and not a painter.

In
his poem Why I Am Not a Painter, Frank Oâ€™Hara is going back and forth between
the painter Mike Goldbergâ€™s work Sardines, and Oâ€™Haraâ€™s own set of poems,
Oranges. The poemâ€™s tense is present, except when describing the process of the
painting, where it turns to present continuous. It is also present continuous
at the pre-process of writing, with the word thinking. 



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Although the poem is in present
tense, it is not a narrative poem. A non-narrative. Thereâ€™s no cause and effect
relationship between the events, and sometimes no connection between the
sentences.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The painter Mike Goldberg comes
across as confident and knowledgeable about his art. He invites the poet to
drink while working, such a pleasurable activity! When the poet asks a
question, the painter always has a clear cut answer. The poet could enviously experience
the process of the painting. 



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Oâ€™Hara depicts the process of
writing differently. Thereâ€™s the thinking.
The actual poem writing is not described, as if it is magical and done without
the poetâ€™s control. He wants to write about orange, how orange is awful like
life, he fills pages with trying to depict his thinking, but he canâ€™t do it
accurately. There is the inadequacy of words to be true to the conveyance of
reality. He is circling his subject, orange, with the object of his words,
referencing his ideas the way Gertrude Stein referenced her objects in Tender
Buttons, indirectly. Thereâ€™s frustration.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The process of writing is depicted
as a difficult, magical process. Compared to the painter, the poet is helpless
in his writing. In the deep experience of writing, he is thrilled to discover
himself a real poet, looking wonderingly at what is coming out of his alchemic
efforts: prose.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thereâ€™s a sense of fun and wonder in
the poem. Fun with the abstract ideas of words, orange or sardines, fun
with (named) friends and drinking, conversation, fun with experimentation in
language as an artifice of the urban world. The poem mixes traditional mediums
of the separate arts. Words used for painting, and colors for poetry. This mix
in art mediums points further to the level of experimentation and fun. Oâ€™Hara
is using a conversational style, in his famous â€œI do this I do thatâ€ form. The
line breaks are apt form for bringing further surprises in every new line. The
line breaks add to the â€œand thenâ€ style of the poemâ€™s unfolding.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yet, with the sense of fun, thereâ€™s
also the dark side, that always peeks into Oâ€™Haraâ€™s poems. In this poem the
dark side is the meaning of the written poems in Oranges. The meaning that is
so needed, and is so hard to portray.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the end, it is the dark side that
makes him a poet. We come to see that both the painter and the poet use words.
The painter uses the word sardines as
a visual for his canvas. The poet uses the word orange to convey an abstract idea of color. For both, words are
representational, an object and a symbol. Thereâ€™s no direct answer to the
question, why I am not a painter. Thereâ€™s the fun, the pain, the mystery of
writing and the resulting pride.

    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


Your last paragraph is a good description of the 'irony' of the situation. You deal with the form of the poem and what it means for the poet. I liked you notice of how he uses the word ""Well"" to change tacks about how he veiws his talent as opposed to his friend's talent. Well Done!

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.  This is where the text of your essay goes.
With
â€œA liquor never brewedâ€, Emily Dickinson is referring to the Nature, and
throughout this poem, she is using different lively metaphors to show how much
the nature enthralls and captivates her. She is enjoying and drinking in the
beauty of the nature the way one tastes wine till drunk and inebriate. In the
second sentence, the author drinks a liquor â€œfrom tankards scooped in pearlâ€,
suggesting that pearl, the essence of the nature, is exactly the kind of â€œwine
never brewedâ€ she is tasting. The description also implies that the tankards, i.e.
drinking cups, overflow and brim with pearl, which is also a beautiful creation
that takes time to develop in a shell deep in the ocean before it becomes refined
and perfect, just like a wine which takes time to brew or years to store before
it becomes richly tasty. This is the first metaphor in the poem, inspiring the readers
to feel the power and depth of the nature through a new sense (of taste) and perspective.
The author also associates the nature with the magic and powerful effects of wine, a sensual
experience commonly shared. 

In
the second paragraph, the author is inebriate and drunk of air while indulging
herself in dew like an addiction. Air is the natureâ€™s vital component which
gives life to all creations on earth. It also reminds people of a healthy,
refreshing state when one breathes in ample fresh air. Dew, on the other hand,
signifies the start of a morning, the hope of another new day. It is the precious
drops sparkling on leaves, condensation and gem of the nature. According to
dictionary, debauchee is a person addicted to excessive indulgence in sensual
pleasure. It has negative connotation like the word â€œinebriateâ€ which implies
someone is intoxicated, static and unconscious. With the ironic contrast between
inebriate vs. air and debauchee vs. dew (positive vs. negative), the author obviously presents a very
new and different way of thinking and appreciation for nature which broadens our imagination and
extends our sensory limits. 

With
â€œReeling, through endless summer daysâ€, there is something valuable coming from
 the incessant cycle of summer, the most vibrant season of the nature. It also
resonates with â€œthe Sunâ€ mentioned in the last sentence of the poem, which symbolizes
eternity, unlimited energy and core of the universe. While inns are usually
where travelers stay and enjoy refreshment like food and beverage, the wine of
the nature comes from â€œinns of molten blueâ€. Molten means liquefied, whereas
blue probably stands for water. It could be a running river or the ocean, full
of life.

In
the third paragraph, the author â€œshall but drink the moreâ€ when bees and
butterflies, both summer insects, are so drunk too till they are expelled or
give up their last cup. The author personifies the insects and considers them as
her drinking fellows, celebrating life together wildly and enjoying life to the
full.

In the last paragraph, angels (seraphs) and saints make
their appearance in the poem. They embody sacredness of the nature which is Godâ€™s
creation. Seraphs swing their snowy hats, a metaphor of clouds moving in heavens.
Saints on earth, who desires to see God, rush to the window, which symbolizes the
letting in of light and enlightenment. And the little tippler they see is
either metaphoric to the spirit of the nature or the Creator who enjoys His
creation -- the nature and the earth, so much like one tastes a wine. But it is the most divine, profound alcohol, a liquor never brewed! (i.e. non-alcohol, sinless and sacred)

You had a very neat, original poem. I prefer the 2nd version with the pronouns omitted, as I am personally a fan of condensory. I also believe that it leaves the poem more open than the original, and therefore a bit more interesting (although I still very much liked the first). However, I noticed that you left out ""is"" in the last line of the first stanza. This should have been kept since it is a verb, not a pronoun. The third version, though not my favorite, was very interesting to read and to note the differences between it and the original. Your explanations were very well created, and they gave a good summary of each poem. Great job!

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Reviewing of this essay turns out to be a very difficult task. 
The essay  should have been about what makes the second version of ""Young Woman at a Window"" more imagist than the first version of the poem. It should have explained how the versions conform to the principles and ideas of imagism as they are declared in the manifesto.
But it is a different essay.  It speaks about ""the shut window"".  The interpretation is  extensive, interesting and thought provoking. It would have been a perfect example of an essay if the task were to simply do a close reading of the versions.

I think you did a really good job of actually quoting the poem and then explaining what you thought of it and also giving a few definitions here and there. I also loved how you explained the inns of molten blue and how you pictured this in your own mind. However, I got a little lost at the part when you spoke about men drinking at a bar and how Dickinson wouldn't get kicked out.

Your essay has helped me appreciate the force of opposites in this poem, both how they create tension and meaning. This essay flows nicely, moving from stanza to stanza in a way that was pleasant to read. I thought your observation that ""The 'butterflies' and 'bees' move from one 'summer' flower to the next, as a poet ...from one idea... to another, and ...anticipate the ...shift....that comes with the fourth stanza,"" was especially good. This made me wonder if, in a longer essay, you might have something interesting to say about the use of opposition versus shift in this poem. Your discussion of Dickinson's use of dashes and form would be more interesting if tied to your main argument regarding her use of contrast. Going through this essay and eliminating some unnecessary phrasing would highlight your ideas, and I suspect, would lead you deeper into your insights.

        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


I liked this point that the essayist made best of all, ""a poet must condense and erase, just like the painter has had to do."" I also appreciated your comparisons of O'Hara's process with that of Godlberg's and the fact that O'Hara (the poet) begins with visual, picuturesque inspiration whereby Goldberg (the painter) begins with a written word to inspire the blank canvas. I, too, mentioned the similarities among the two men in their creative process. Nicely done and clearly written.

I really appreciate the way you have analysed the poetry and tried to explain the meanings and metaphors that are used by the poet.
I like the God and Nature interpretation. However, one thing that I feel you should know is Dickinson was not much of a believer, rather she was a rebel who did not believe in God.
Never mind, for I feel poetry interpretation should be both from the view of the poet as well as from that of the reader. Good job!

11575,1379883526,"Wow, [REDACTED]! What a wonderful poem you wrote...My interpretation of the poem is that she's trying to tell us that there is not an absolute truth or only one way. I thought of that by trying to follow the possible ""breadcrumbs"" she left along the poem. First of all she speaks about religion and that's curious: Isn't religion The way or the truth according to some people? Then she keeps going on her life, or she just leaves the church and goes home, listening to other people's incomplete conversations on the way, to other Is who carry other truths and beliefs with them, other than religious ones. And finally she discovers through the books (through her abandonment in stories made of trees) that there is not such a thing as an unique way or truth. She discovers (and that's the gasp) that the way is considering all the ways, because there is a piece of the truth hidden everywhere, with everyone. Every person has a story to tell, so every person carries a piece of the truth and we must listen to each one of them equally.Does that make any sense to you? ",3.0

The beginning of this reading, not yet an essay, contains some acute observations: I agree that the poem is"" about experiencing ecstasy through nature, ""the bouncer at the bar"" is a lovely phrase and could be applicable to the ""landlord"" cutting off the drunken bees, but this writer sees the poem's movement as seasonal, through time, and doesn't provide convincing evidence for that reading, unless it is inspired by ""the snowy hats"" of the seraphs in the last stanza, though there is little else to support it except the ""endless summer days,"" which are not connected to images of spring or fall.  And the writing treats the different elements of the poem separately without pulling them together into an integrated whole.

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Great interpretation!

The
title â€œWhy I Am Not a Painterâ€ is supposed to engage the reader in a
comparative assessment
between pictorial and poetic production. Like Lessing whose â€œLaocoÃ¶n and the
limits of painting and poetryâ€ seems to elevate poetic production above
painting, Oâ€™Hara too seems to suggest the superiority of literary over visual
representation as a means of artistic expression. In the two stanzas that
follow, however, his arguments do not unfold rationally, despite the poemâ€™s
deceptive simplicity and straightforward language. Rather
Oâ€™Hara makes use of an anamorphic perspective, that is he creates a distorted
projection which requires the reader to â€œoccupy a specific vantage pointâ€
(wiki) to reconstitute the verbal image. I use the term â€œanamorphosisâ€ (from
the Greek words meaning formed again)
in order to describe the transformation of the two dimensional pictorial image
of the â€œSardinesâ€ into a multi- dimensional poetic image of the â€œOranges.â€ After
posing the question Why (not a painter)? the poet proceeds in the first stanza
to expose the limits and limitations of pictorial representation. Mike Goldberg,
who is his New York school painter-friend, seems very much at ease with his
vocation. He seems to respond intuitively to the demands of his painting. He
claims for example, that the Sardines belong to the painting because ""it
needed something there."" At a later version of the painting, however, the
Sardines are substituted with painted letters (possibly the letters that make
up the word â€œSardinesâ€). To the
poetâ€™s question on the elimination of the Sardines, the painter replies â€œit was
too much,â€ implying that an objective depiction of the Sardines in the painting
is redundant or perhaps it would damage the various imaginative interpretations
of the painting by limiting its explication to one and specific realistic
reference to a school of Sardines. Considering however that Sardines are a type
of fish that migrates along the coast in large schools or that in popular
culture, Sardines can invoke a situation where people or objects are crowded
together, for instance, in a bus or subway car, the finished painting without
the Sardines albeit having retained the name â€œSardinesâ€ in its title, could to
be taken to be a subtle critique of mass urban culture. Thus, the painting
involves a degree of abstraction but is nevertheless confined to its
two-dimensional nature.

In
the second stanza the poet juxtaposes the process of literary creation to that
of a painting. The germ of his work is the color â€œorange.â€ Apparently, he
cannot convey the meaning and associative significance of this color by depicting
orange objects onto the canvas; this is something that his painter-friend might
have done and even he did not seem to consider this type of realistic representation
adequate. This is why both the painter and the poet resort to words.Â  But if the invocation of a word and its
meaning through its letters fulfills the purpose of the painting, for the poet
a few words or a line are not enough to convey the multitude of sensations and
meanings and affective significance the term â€œorangeâ€ evokes. Or, as the poet
characteristically says â€œThere should be so much moreâ€¦of words, of how terrible
orange is and life.â€ I take this to mean that the poet exercises free
association, he writes down pages and pages of unconstrained association of
ideas without submitting his work to emotional censorship or imposing formal
limitations to it. The
freer and more uninhibited his prose is, the more real a poet he becomes, he
claims. Thus, the text he envisioned to write on the color â€œorangeâ€ has already
undergone a transformation: the poetic line has become pages and pages of
prose. But, just like the painter had to give up representational art to attain
a multiplicity of meanings, in turn the true poet has to sacrifice the illusion
that linguistic transparency and meaning are conveyed when breaking free from
formal constraints. So his text undergoes yet a second transformation: from
poetic prose it has become a collection of twelve poems under the title ORANGES,
an example of which is the poem we are reading. As artists, both Oâ€™Hara and
Goldberg face the same problems of artistic expression. Both make similar but
not identical artistic choices. Oâ€™Haraâ€™s ORANGES stand in anamorphic relation
to Goldbergâ€™s SARDINES, while in both the object of representation has been
removed from the artwork.Â Â Â

From your initial observation that the Baroness ""of course"" wanted three-and-a-half mesostics to your final conclusion that this might be as close as you'll ever get to being inside her mind, you write in a style that is fresh and light and breezy and entertaining. At the same time, you present a close analysis and interesting ideas about the punctuation, the meanings of many of the words and phrases in the mesostics, and on the philosophical issue of who ""wrote"" these mesostics. Very well done. And I am now thinking seriously of hanging a ""chemicals in all trouble--they're you"" sign in my study.

    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much

    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have listed four questions below that can be used as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. We have also recorded an audio-only discussion of ""I taste a liquor never brewed."" Listen to this recording before you answer the rubric questions: it will provide you with an example of how to close read Dickinson's poem. You can find the link to the recording here.
1. Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? In other words, does the essay quote the words used by the poet? We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay do this?
2. Does the essay say something about how Dickinson's dashes works? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay deal with the dashes?
3. Does the essay account in some way for the stanzaic form of the poem? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay discuss how the poem's form interacts with its content? Does the essay, for example, describe the way in which the speaker's figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble?
4. Does the essay in some way follow the poem's shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the essay account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 

The essay does a nice job of breaking down each stanza and tying the together. The writer of the essay references biblical literature and actually makes a direct connection between passages in the bible and stanzas in the poem. These comparisons are very effective and demonstrate the essay writer's knowledge of the bible and biblical references. While I am not sure that the biblical undertones is the intent of the author it is certainly an intriguing  and well constructed analysis. I particularly like the work done with the idea of spirit, renewal and transcendence, ideas that I believe would have been consistent with the writings of Emily Dickinson.

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Wonderful written English!    1. You successfully discuss that  V2 is condensed in ways that fit the Imagist Manifesto.  2.  No discussion of grammar, which may be hard to do in a foreign language.  3. You noted the preposition ""there"" so I know you are on to this, but have not fully developed it.  You noted the ambiguous language pertaining to the ""theft"" and ""robbery"" by the child.  Your essay is similar to mine and I feel it is well done for a beginner level of poetry in general and Imagism in particular.  The grading suggestions #4 and #5 are quite advanced expectations that I'm sure most of us have not achieved.  Thank you for taking the time to do this assignment thoroughly.  Enjoy the rest of class!

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
Form:

 

The form of the poem is that of four stanzas, each
comprising four lines of alternating iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.  The only deviation from this form is in the
line â€˜Reeling â€“ throâ€¦â€™ where the first word has a natural trochaic beat.  The rhythm of the poem has a driving quality
enhanced by the regular iambic meter; the use of dashes gives it a breathless,
emotionally intense tone which is enhanced by the exclamation marks terminating
the first and third stanza.

 

Metaphor:

The dominant conceit of the poem is that of nature as an
intoxicating liquor, partaken of by both the creatures of the world (the
butterflies and bees) and the speaker. 
The speaker lays claim to primacy in this regard, since (by the third
stanza at least) she will â€˜drink the moreâ€™ even when the butterflies and bees
are sated.  In this she echoes the
bravado of drinkers at a certain stage of intoxication everywhere.

The inclusion of christian iconography(?) (seraphs, the highest angels in the
heavenly choir; saints, the most honored of religious humankind) links the speakerâ€™s
experience of nature with the highest forms of religious feeling: the
intoxication of the first three stanzas becomes a â€˜divine intoxicationâ€™ in the
final stanza, as the speaker is united (perhaps in death or unconsciousness)
with the sun-godhead in what could be described as Dionysian ecstasy.  

The state of her head the morning after such a â€˜sessionâ€™ is
not discussed.

In other contexts, the purported respect and interest shown
by the saints and seraphs towards the speaker might feel indicative of an
unhealthy egotism on her part.  However,
the almost parental affection suggested by the description of her as a â€˜little
Tipplerâ€™ renders the effect charming and lightly touched with a pathos that
provides a counterbalance to the ecstatic conclusion of the final line of the
poem.

 

The lines â€˜Inebriate of Air â€“ am I â€“ / And Debauchee of Dew â€“â€˜:

I would like to examine these two lines in detail.  In the first line, the literal reading is
that the speaker is inebriated by air, which could be something as mundane as describing
the dizziness induced by hyperventilation. 
However, the way in which the line is crafted offers much more.  To be an â€˜inebriate of airâ€™ is suggestive of
being an â€˜initiateâ€™, which in turn is allusive of membership of secret
societies or religious orders.  There is
a sense in which the speaker is claiming membership of both of these societies in
her relationship with nature; that she is privy to, and fully sensible of, the
natural world in a way which is unusual, rare and â€˜spiritualâ€™.  In this way, the simple arrangement of the
first three words provides a sense in which the simple act of breathing has
been transfigured into a communion.  The
final almost-pause of the dash before the concluding â€˜am Iâ€™ makes this claim
emphatic.

There is another aspect in which â€˜inebriateâ€™ contributes to
the meaning of the poem in a way â€˜inebriatedâ€™ would not.  The latter connotes an act concluded, something
which has already happened, while â€˜inebriateâ€™ suggests an ongoing process, the speakerâ€™s
relationship with nature is open-ended and ongoing.  There is an eternal, living-in-the-moment
quality to â€˜inebriateâ€™ which is entirely lacked by â€˜inebriatedâ€™.

The great satisfaction that the speaker feels in her
relationship with nature is suggested by the emphatic use of â€˜Andâ€™ to begin the
second line.  It is as if she is saying: to
be an inebriate of air is a great gift, but to also be a debauchee of dew â€“ well,
who could ask for more?  

The use of â€˜debaucheeâ€™ mirrors the â€˜inebriateâ€™ of the first
line, though there is an escalation in the emotional register of these words.  To be inebriated is one (possibly temporary) thing,
to be debauched connotes something more serious and permanent: to be corrupted,
dissolute, coarsened, etc.  By linking
these words to air and dew, the speaker creates a contrast which overthrows
their usual negative connotations.  The crude,
heavy, foggy associations the word â€˜inebriateâ€™ might carry are inverted by the spacious
clarity and light associated with â€˜airâ€™; in the same fashion the jewel-like, clean,
fresh associations of the word â€˜dewâ€™ act to subvert the usual meaning of â€˜debauchâ€™.  Christian associations (with heaven, with manna)
may be drawn from â€˜airâ€™ and â€˜dewâ€™ respectively. 


By subverting the normal meanings of inebriation and
debauchery, the speaker reinforces the sense that her relationship with nature
is special: in that context she has the freedom and power to overrule the norms
and conventions of human society and language. 
The power that she feels is supported by the driving rhythm established
by the pairs of iambic tetrameter and trimeter that make up each stanza, the
almost breathless quality imparted by the use of hyphens, and the alliteration and assonance between â€˜inebriateâ€™
/ â€˜airâ€™ and â€˜debaucheeâ€™ / â€˜dewâ€™ in this particular pair of lines.

 

On nature:

There is an appealing plainness to the nature described by
the speaker, a demotic accessibility. 
There is no requirement for majestic redwoods or rare orchids to induce
the intoxication she describes: it is available in the plants and animals anyone
might find in any field.  Shorn of adjectival
qualifiers, they are rendered in their most generic form: a butterfly, a
foxglove...  If there is any specificity
in the vision of nature she evokes, it is the season and perhaps unusual warmth
implied by a sky of â€˜Molten Blueâ€™.   Despite
this, there is a sense that the warmth she feels is only partly climatic:
personal ardor, if not the purely physiological flush accompanying alcoholic
intoxication, is equally suggested.  In
both senses of the word, the very atmosphere of the poem is heated.

    2. What does this essay have to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?
    For writing experiments and essays written by students choosing Option B:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing? Does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtaposition(s) between
        the original and the ""written-through"" experiment?
    2. Does the writer have something to say about this kind of ""writing through"" a previous text, or about aleatory or ""unoriginal"" poetry generally? Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?

Well, I wish I had *your* impressions of the experiments!  First, Virgin - I like it.  Whatever the original looked like, I really appreciate the clean language of this version. It is very spare and evocative.  My favourite line is ""our feet darkening the floor"".  What a perfect way to describe wet feet on raw, worn wood.  I'm certainly inspired to try this, myself, on some of my writing that i know to be too flowery to bother submitting anywhere.
As for Alea jacta est, that title certainly brought a smile to my face. My husband and I both had classical educations, so my children have heard that phrase more times than they can count.  I really enjoy found poetry, but in my own work with it, I always strive to make it accessible.  This truly has the feel of aleatory poetry.  It feels random, there is no obvious sense of communication from the writer, until the last line.  Do you like it, yourself?  Which is your favourite, of the two?

The Colonel



What you have heard is
true. I was in his house. His wife carried
a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails, his son went
out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the
cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over
the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English.
Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to
scoop the kneecaps from a manâ€™s legs or cut his hands to lace. On
the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had
dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for
calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of
bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief
commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was
some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot
said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed
himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say
nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries
home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like
dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one
of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water
glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As
for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them-
selves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last
of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some
of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the
ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.

        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


A letter to O 'Hara  - what a clever and delightful approach to the assignment! This is so readable, I'd like to quote lines from it. For example, I love your lines about colors equalling letters equalling lines and  about how painters choose ""concision"" and poets choose ""expansion"" , although I don't really believe it. Remember ""The Condensary""? Nevertheless, I really enjoyed reading your essay since it is so in the spirit of the New York school. Thanks !

"" A flower (foxglove) naturally dies taking away the food source of the bee causing it to search out another flower. The bee has been evicted by the circle of life. ""--The flower is pollinated by the bee and the bee gathers the nectar and pollen of the flowers to make honey, beebread, beeswax, etc.--Don't see any reference to death here, just the drunken bee getting 86'd from the flower bar.
""And finally, she ascends to the heavens""--Think you are taking that way too literally--I don't think she is actually supposed to be leaning against the sun--I think she is lightheartedly(pun intended) comparing herself to the drunk who is held up by the lamppost(street light--light)--she is also being held up by a light, but of course hers is not man made.
All that being said, I do think you are getting the overall idea of the poem.  It is very much about the way nature inebriates one in opposition to even the best alcohol man can make.

TEXT OF ESSAY GOES HERE. Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form. This is where the text of your essay goes.
Each poem can be read as a single sentence.Â  The sentence in version 1 includes subordination, and sets up Â a relationship between child and woman, centering on the child's ambiguous ""theft"" from the woman, about which he knows nothing, and, inÂ  hinting at this relationship,Â WCW focuses attention on the subjectivities of woman and child. Â In Version 2, by effacing the relationship and interiority of version 1, Wiliams shortens the poem by one couplet (six words) and ""flattens,"" or sharpens the image, and also removes the temporal element which asks for story, and associated expectations of motivation and action.Â  In the first poem, by starting with the word ""while,"" WCW actually makes the child the subject of the sentence and focuses attention on his innocent theft, a motivated, if unconscious, action. Â  In the second version, time is removed, story and motivation are erased, the child is not the subject, just part of the scene, belongingÂ as inÂ a still-life to the holding vessel of the woman. Â There is no robbery mentioned, no innocent lack of knowing, and the child is not initiating the act of rubbing his nose.Â  Most of these changes are accomplished by excision of words, and a slight reordering.Â  WCW also addsÂ severalÂ Â elements, which enhance the visual aspects of the scene.Â  The child is now ""in her lap.""Â Â ""Little"" has been eliminated -- perhapsÂ a redundancy with ""child""-- and ""the child"" is rendered perhaps more distinctly (imagistically), more specifically, expressed by his sitting on the woman's lap.Â  So there is still a relationship between child and woman, but it is a spatial relationship, not a relationship hinted at by action and subjective state. ""This little child/who robs her""Â  becomes ""the child."" Â Even the displacement of ""the child"" to the second line of a couplet, rather than the first, deemphasizes the child's subjectivity.Â  He's just one more part of herÂ  (""her hand, the child,"") an unprivileged part of the still life, not identified, even, as ""her child."" The poem ends with the second major alteration.Â  The child is no longer rubbing his nose -- the theft is completely suppressed -- but ""his nose/pressed/to the glass"" represents a compressionÂ --Â  again a shift from an action which requires time and subjectivity to a momentary image, ""hard and clear.""Â  Of course the words, ""pressed/to the glass"" sound almost like a metapoetic reference to the imagist manifesto, asking for a poetry to describe what the world looks like if it were pressed to glass, as if the world were hard and clear.Â  ""Pressed,"" the only one word line of the poem, suggests and possibly enactsÂ both spatial and temporal compression.Â  Although poetry of this sort achieves a kind of ""definiteness,""Â  by its very suppression of action, motivation and relationships, its reliance on visual juxtaposition, its undefinedness, it engages the reader's subjectivity differently.Â  The poem itself is not a beautiful object, nor does it describe beauty, but it seems to lay claim on our own moral imagination, as we wonder: who, what, where and why.Â P.S. Â Although the imagists eschew traditional forms, Version 2 scans better to my ear. Â ""Glass"" sounds almost like a terminal rhyme. Â I think it picks ups the short ""a"" of hand, and is Â anticipated by the consonantal sibilance of ""pressed.""Â

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
You show how the first version does not fulfill the Imagist manifesto.  I like your metaphor of a garden pruner to describe WCW's second version of the poem. While you point out how this version uses condensation, you do not discuss how the poet achieves this through the use of grammar, punctuation, form. You also need to think about the poet's subjectivity in the second version.  Is the poet using narrative or suppressing narrative in the second version?

    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view?

    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


A very interesting take on the poem - i was fascinated with the cross referencing. 
You covered the painting Vs Poetry bit - infact I loved the idea of I drink - we drink... and how drink could be anything...

1. Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? In other words, does the essay quote the words used by the poet? We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay do this?
2. Does the essay say something about how Dickinson's dashes works? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay deal with the dashes?
3. Does the essay account in some way for the stanzaic form of the poem? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay discuss how the poem's form interacts with its content? Does the essay, for example, describe the way in which the speaker's figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble?
4. Does the essay in some way follow the poem's shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the essay account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 

This essay was clearly written by someone who knows a lot about poetry, but I felt the writer did not make enough effort to share his or her thoughts with the reader.  The essay uses jargon, or perhaps scholarly short-hand, such as ""entheogenic experience of the I-lyrical"" instead of elaborating on the writer's ideas.  Overall, the essay has good ideas but states  them in a much too condensed manner.

A very perceptive essay closely following the apparent difference between the poet and the painter. The second  and the third stanzas have been effectively juxtaposed thereby treating the subject in a convincing manner. The mention of self-editing has been interesting In a way that generates a whole new approach to the process of creating their final pieces. The mention of time passing and the final evolution of the artists' impressions have been presented with much skill and the attention to detail.
Well done!

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
The whole poem â€œI Taste A Liquor Never Brewedâ€, holds
several references to alcohol and â€œinebriationâ€, such as â€˜liquorâ€™, â€˜Tankardsâ€™, â€˜drunkenâ€™
and so on. The poet talks of her love for nature, whose pleasure is above any
alcohol that man can make. The poet uses the ballad
form with a rhyming scheme abcb. 

In the first stanza, the poet introduces the reader to the
liquor that she has drunk giving her a great load of pleasure. She goes on to
illustrate the liquor by saying that it is â€œScooped in Pearlâ€. She compares it
to the alcohol of the â€œRhineâ€, Rhine
being a river in Germany, a country very well â€“ known for it Beer. The
exclamation at the end of the last line, further expresses the superiority of
the alcohol that she talks of. But, the interesting part of this stanza is the
first line! The poet says the alcohol that she is enjoying is â€œnever brewedâ€, therefore starting the poem in a
sort of a suspense as to what the poet is talking about. The next three lines
further increase the suspense regarding what the poet is talking about.The mystery of this alpha alcohol is solved in the second
stanza. She says that she is â€œInebriateâ€ of the â€œairâ€ and â€œdewâ€. These words
clearly show that she is talking of the nature that
surrounds her. She enjoys the â€œendless summer daysâ€ and the â€œmolten Blueâ€,
which is the sky. The â€œReelingâ€ shows us the extent of her intoxication. It
seems that the poet has lost control of herself, and an imagery of the world
reeling around her is created, sending the reader also into a reeling
experience.In the third stanza the poet compares herself to the other creatures,
such as the Bees and the Butterflies. These could be references to other beings
who are intoxicated by their own interests, but her intoxication by nature
exceeds all such cases.  the usage of
bees and butterflies, adds to the reference of nature in the poem. The
exclamation at the end of the stanza presents a sort of a mockery to those who
get drunk easily. She sort of suggests that her drinking  has only just begun.The final stanza is a continuation of the previous stanza. â€œSeraphsâ€ are angels of the highest order in
Christian mythology. This reference to religion is significant, since Christianity
is a religion that believes that Man is above nature, and it is present only to
serve man. Hence Nature is demystified by angels and saint. But the poet rebels
against this idea, and promotes the beauty and pleasure of nature. She brings nature up to a pedestal, high enough to be crazy over. Further, she lauds
herself, by saying that she is going to get so drunk that even Angels and
Saints would look back to see her â€œleaning against the Sunâ€. This shows that the poet is ready to throw a challenge to those who hold ideas other than the one that the poem holds, about nature. 







The poem is very interesting in its usage of Dickinsonâ€™s
famous dashes. There doesn't
seem to be a set pattern, which accentuates the drunken state of the poet. Therefore, the reading of the poem also gives a sense of drunkenness to the reader. The
exclamation points used, in both situations, have a deeper meaning that just
surprise, which is very amusing to the reader. This humour
adds to the reading experience.

Love the title you've picked...it's a keeper, and it certainly grabbed my attention and drew me in. I think you've got a fairly good grasp on much of what the NY Style of poets are about, especially regards the ""I did this, I did that"" mode of writing, on which O'Hara has relied heavily in this poem. Because this is such a challenging poem about a rather enigmatic poet, I found the Peer Review Evaluation/Feedback questions and optional considerations particularly enlightening and helpful and have been suggesting to every essayist I review, that exploring them, and especially, viewing the video linked within, is a worthwhile endeavour.  I enjoyed reading your essay. I hope you enjoy the video Prof Filreis and the TA's have created to further explore this poem.

    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


Interesting essay. You argued well for the idea that he is really showing the similarities in the creative impulse. You paid attention to some of the formal aspect of the poem and showed how they participate in answering your theme. Well done.

Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
The essay does describebhow version two isbshorter but more clear and understanding then version one.  The essay always notices some grammar like when they talk about wjawhat does the woman actually mean by certain things. The writer also shows how version two is more clear and shows you a good photograph in your head by what the writer is telling us.

This is an excellent essay that deals precisely and explicitly with the five points of the credo of the Imaginist manifesto.  The writer explains in detail how the grammar of the first version is streamlined and made more exact with the second, removing unnecessary parts of speech. The underlying message is clearly put --  fewer words: more is less here as is shown in the essay.  The condensation in the second poem more powerfully brings home the poet's poem with a few clear select images. In section 5 there is an interesting nod toward iconic Christian pose -- Madona and child.  This might be a ""Make It New"" approach but I found the interpretation given during the web cam of a mother with Williams' illegitimate child more in keeping with modern imagery.

I think it is very interesting that this essay makes connections within and outside the contexts of the poem. The references to Whitman, Buddhism and Tennyson is effective and shows clear understanding of suggesting a place beyond the confines of the words. Well done for not simply re-narrating the poem, but making very poignant points about the language and metaphor in each line. The most interesting part for me is this theory of a ""happy suicide"", where the all natural Sun is the object to kill her in the end. You could have mentioned the dashes and the form of the stanzas a little more, possibly referring to any particular patterns? It was also very perceptive of you to pick up on the fragility of the poem, and how Dickinson's words can be applied to modern times.

The discussion is thorough and goes through each of the stanzas of the poem. Although several images are discussed, it does however remain rather a paraphrasing of the poem. There is little discussion of the higher level processes going on, in particular the alingment of content and form (through aliteration, resembling the drunkard's slurred speach) or the shifting of the metaphors, corresponding to the increasing level of inebriation.

53762,1383985911,"You are quite welcome, but actually the post was quite interesting throughout.There
 is somewhere on the web, and I wish I could remember where or had 
bookmarked it, a poem which is essentially many of these sorts of 
sentences, some relating to several people who appear again and again, 
some without much context, which are I believe sorted in a random order 
when you go to the page and then served in that order as you click 
through them. I think there are 99 or some such number.But the 
experience your piece had me thinking of was taking a box of random 
objects, gathered through my childhood and having enough significance 
that I can remember where they came from, and why I saved them, and 
taking them out of the box one by one, and, when the box was empty, 
putting them back in again.The experience of reading Hejinian definitely varies based on familiarity with the text.The
 association of sentence with object makes me also think of the idea of 
systems of divination, I Ching or especially Tarot. One can do tarot 
readings with any sort of objects, if one has a vocabulary or can create
 a vocabulary in which these objects are ""words,"" as one does with tarot
 cards.I think Daniel Bergmann might have some amazing insights 
into what you are talking about, so if anyone happens to have his 
contact information, maybe they could direct him here. I have a lot of 
autism spectrum traits, and one thing that I think belongs among those 
is being hyperaware of how one's brain is working.There are also
 some interesting intersections of poetry with sculpture that can create
 different geometries than the linearity of a flat page for ""reading"" textual information.When
 I begin writing a poem, I cannot compose on a computer, and lined paper
 is a major distraction. I need blank paper, where I can put words in at
 least a full two-dimensional space on the page, possibly with different
 handwritings, and maybe in slightly different directions.Once I
 get going, my process becomes linear, but maybe I could train myself to
 write non-linear poetry. My goal in writing poetry is to evoke or 
communicate emotion, usually to say in words what is impossible to say 
in words, so Hejinian and Silliman are much more to my taste than many 
of the more radical experimental poets we are looking at.I think
 the statement ""different words are superior to each other"" sounds like 
something Yogi Berra would say, or like something from ""A Hole Is to Dig.""
 I am not quite sure how you would set up a scale to even argue that one
 word was superior to another. Has the letter earliest in the alphabet? 
Is longer? Is shorter? But thinking about how a word leads to another 
sounds like a good exercise.Flocking behaviour in birds, the way
 the waveform of a flock of birds flows like a screensaver, can be 
modeled by having birds try to keep close to their two nearest 
neighbors. What is flocking of words like?Are you familiar with Edward Gorey? Especially ""The Object Lesson"" relates to this post. A lot of his work calls causality into question.",2.0

As an autodidact I am always thrilled to read something that teaches me something new.  And I certainly was gratified in reading this essay to learn about slant rhyme as demonstrated by pearl and alcohol in the first stanza.    I was also thrilled to learn a synonym for juxtaposition in the use of the word collocation.  This was the first essay that I read that had an explanation regarding the double ""en"" dashes used throughout the poem and its use in creating a visual image of a person under the influence of alcohol.    It was also interesting to ponder the poetess attempting to break free of the bonds of social convention or as pointed out in this essay her own superego.    This was an excellent essay on a marvelous poem.

Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay.Â We have included an optional set of questions that you may use when reading your peers' essays. Use these questions
        as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. We have also recorded a video discussion of ""Why I Am Not a Painter."" If you can, watch this recording
        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
At the first stanza of the poem Dickinson says about an extremely tastefull liquor, hard to find and she seems to enjoy the experience. At the time Dickinson lived it was inappropriate for a woman to drink alcohol but she is not afraid to write for it and she doesn't care how society could judge her.At the second stanza she is inebriated of Air  with capital A and debauchee of Dew with capital D which shows the charm of the nature and the power it has on her. But also i think she gets sad and feels powerless just like alcohol makes you feel sometimes and she is reeling through the hot summer days that seem endless and she can do nothing to avoid it. Next stanza is full of metaphors with bugs (bees, butterflies) and i think she is talking about vicious, malevolent people (compared with bees which have the sting and cause harm) and unconcerned ostensible people. And when all these people dissapear from her life she would be able to drink more, she is going to be free and the bad things of her social life will be away.At the end of the poem, in the last line the tippler is going to the sun which represents the light, the life and the eternity. The sun is a  metaphor for the wisdom, the peacefull life and only someone sensitized with nature and inebriated with air can gain that.

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
I agree. I like to work harder to get my conclusions. Very thorough job.

I hadn't put any religious connotations on this poem when I read it.  Was Emily involved in religion?  Did she write other poems expressing her beliefs?  Now I am curious.  I love reading the different interpretations.

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
                I
taste a liquor never brewed, / From tankards scooped in pearl; This
beginning to the first stanza implies that what Dickinson is â€œingestingâ€ is
even more exquisite than the finest of liquors. It is also possible that she
means that it is impossible for the liquor she enjoys to be contained in a
tankard. Not all the vats upon the Rhine
/ Yield such an alcohol! The Rhine is a river that runs through Germany.
Germany; of course, is known for its alcohol. In saying this, Dickinson means
that the drunkenness she experiences is more than that which could be contained
in a multitude of vats in Germany. 

                Inebriate of air am I, / And debauchee of
dew, It is here that Emily reveals that the alcohol she tastes is truly the
elation of being in nature. She is intoxicated by air and dew, and; presumably,
all things in nature. Reeling, through
endless summer days, / From inns of molten blue. In this, Dickinson says
that sheâ€™s reeling; drunk through endless summer days; the eternal beauty and
exhilaration of nature. The second line, I think means that the sky is the inn;
the tavern from which she drinks. The sky is molten blue, because her senses
are heightened. She is exhilarated in nature, and everything seems better. The
sky isn't just blue- itâ€™s molten
blue.

                When landlords turn the drunken bee / Out of
the foxgloveâ€™s door, / When butterflies renounce their drams, / I shall but
drink the more! I really enjoy this stanza. Emily writes that she will
still continue drinking, even after bees are â€œdrunkâ€ from flowers (the
foxgloves), and the butterflies are finished drinking nectar. It seems that she
is saying that she can continue drinking in nature longer than bees and
butterflies; the very products of nature. The power in the exhilaration she
feels from being in nature is more compelling than a beeâ€™s need for flowers, or
a butterflyâ€™s need for nectar.

                Till seraphs swing their snowy hats, / And
saints to windows run, / To see the little tippler / Leaning against the sun! I
feel like this stanza is a continuation of the previous one; that Emily is
further explaining when she will stop drinking in nature. (A seraph is an angel
of a very high standing.) She writes that she will drink in nature until angels
and saints rush to see her, drunk in delight. This could mean that she wonâ€™t
stop drinking until she sees angles and saints (death.) Or, it could mean that
she will continue to drink forever, because seraphs and saints will never want
to see her personally. I think that the last line, leaning against the sun,
means that she is dependent on the sun, the driving force of nature and light.

                One
thing that is particularly interesting to me is that Emily only tastes the liquor. She doesn't constantly drink it, though it seems that she thinks she does. Perhaps she
means that very rarely does she get the opportunity to get outside and freely
drink in nature, but when she does, it feels as if she will be doing so
forever.

I found the second poem much more successful (and readable) than the first. An interesting choice since you basically have to remove the main topic (""slant"") from the poem. It has the effect, for me, of making the poem feel a little more open and suggestive than the original. I would have liked a little more analysis from your essay, though, as you just begin to comment on how the changes affect the meaning. And given the revelation you mention in your last line, I'm curious as to exactly how the experiment impacted your awareness of language? All in all, a good exercise, thanks for sharing.

Does the essay, for example, describe the way in which the speaker's figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble?
4. Does the essay in some way follow the poem's shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the essay account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so?Â 
The author has taken notice of the elements of modernity in Dickinson:  the coherence of form of meaning, with examples of ''Inebriate of air --"" and a ""Debauchee of Dew --''. This is important for Dickinson's poems.

        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


This is an interesting format to write your essay in. I enjoy your thoughts and connections on certain lines I would have liked it more if you quoted the poem less and just chose certain passages to elaborate on instead of speaking vaguely about the whole poem. Nice thoughts though!

You've really captured ED's sense of exuberance -- that she is ""completely enthralled"" and demonstrates this to the reader with her word choice and shifting array of metaphors. (Surely she would have loved your mention of the nectar in the golden snapdragon blossoms!) You've also captured her clever way of drawing in the reader with riddles and play. Part of the pleasure of reading Dickinson is that her poems can be satisfying on many levels. You have shown that ""I taste a liquor"" can be read and richly enjoyed as a poem of nature and faith.

I found it very clever that you to used a random complaint generator. I found your newly created poem to flow rather well, and it even surprised me few times with my mind generating relationships between words ( Ratial Definitions Skin) ( Work, Agendas, Our Society) (Religion Proof of That). I also did a mesostic and found it to be surprisingly rich with meaning. Your analysis is complete and very much in depth. You construct meaning and defend it, your overall message is clear. Conclusion about abrupt finish of the poem and non-existent finish of the meaning of the poem is clever! 
I do wonder why you chose your spine and how it might or might not relate to your generated text.

I am not sure, why this happened. But your essay has been copied twice here. Doesn't matter. 

The essay is very amazing in its interpretations. The gender perspective in the 5th para where you have compared 'Landlords' with men and 'Drunken bee' as women (like herself and others) is quite interesting. Emily Dickinson's use of words like 'Molten Blue' is indeed vivid which you have rightly acknowledged. I am not sure if the use of 'Foxglove' can be linked to your explanation. Yet, that adds to my knowledge. So, thanks for that. Great job.

We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
I particularly enjoyed the way you drew my attention to prepositions in the second poem and the way they build up the picture in the reader's head. I prefer the first poem, but I am as persuaded by this essay as I ever will be of the highly wrought nature of the second. An 'A' from me.

Thank you for including the original poem by Frost.  I agree with your conclusions about the mesostic versions.  We all seem to be agreeing that the meaning remains much the same in our new versions of the poems.  But now I will go back and question if this is a good thing.  Does this mean that the first poem was too wordy?  And I like you concluded that this form is very open-ended.

I particularly like the way out point out the different sorts of containers that are mentioned in the poem.  I had not noticed this at all and was immediately drawn to this point.  I wish you had extended this point.  Can we see the poem as a kind of container?  Can the idea of containment be linked to the condensation that you point to just after the discussion of containers.

You do an excellent job of describing and discussing the shifting metaphors as ED moves from nature to drinking and back again and I agree that this is a main strength of the poem.

I thought that the most insightful part of your essay was the idea that When ""Landlords"" turn the drunken Bee / Out of the Foxglove's door -"" was a way of referring to the end of summer.  I had not thought of that at all but it seemed obvious to me as soon as you pointed it out.  For me, as a reader, that was the best moment of your essay because it made me see the poem differently.

I liked your essay very much.

It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
An interesting, albeit somewhat clinical, examination of the poem -- I appreciate your technically-oriented approach, deconstructing the components of the language.

To make your reading work I suppose her exploration of the speaker would have to be how she is talking the new morality, otherwise she'd be doing two things at once with her eyes which seems awkward.

""This is a tricky one....""  The writer doesn't want to be told what to think and therefore resents the assignment.  It seems almost as if the writer sets up an evaluation system and purposefully drives toward coming to the opposite conclusion from the assignment, but is this rebellion only or is there some truth here?  It seems to me that the second is employing exact words and grammar, whereas the first is using subordinate clauses.  The subject in the first is the child; the subject in the second is the woman.  That's a pretty big difference, isn't it?  As to cadence, when I read the first poem I felt almost a sing songy cadence.  The second is more jerky.  This writer doesn't examine the cadence of the first as closely as the second, so I can't tell what he/she means by saying the first one is ""all over the place.""  I think the first has a pretty predictable cadence.  I agree that choice of subject is pretty much the same in both subjects:  mother and child.  I don't understand the writer's assertion that poem 1 has a more compelling image - to me, admittedly my opinion, poem 2 is more of a static image with no narration.  I'm at a loss, really, to ""evaluate"", and so my response is that if it can't be suggested that a poem is a certain type, and if we can't be asked to demonstrate the principles of a certain school of writing, what is the class for, anyway?  I recognize an originality in the irony of a scoring system applied to poetry, though, and maybe that was your point?

You interpret the poem as an expression of the authorÂ´s spiritual connection with god, which I think is perfectly valid. Interesting to me are your thoughts about the nature of the speakers intoxication. I thought about it as something solely ecstatic and ""positive"", while you describe it as possibly ""numb"" or causing an ""anesthetic feeling"" as well. If the speaker get numb from drinking the liquor, what does this imply about her spiritual aspirations? 
What you could improve upon in the essay is the analysis of form (IÂ´m not a good teacher here, as I didnÂ´t do it in my own essay).

I enjoyed your interpretation of the poem and your take on the valuable ""liquor""  as that of Dickinson's passion for writing. Am I correct in thinking that you see this as a meta-poem, or a poem about poetry and the passion behind the art of poetry? My take on the poem was that the speaker was ""drunk on nature"" in general, but your reading seems to touch on Dickinson's own personal nature -- I'm drunk on my own inner passion for poetry -- which is an interesting way to look at the poem that I hadn't considered. It is certainly understandable to believe that for Dickinson, words themselves were a sense of life, of breath. I like that idea. I agreed with your view that the Sun represents a sort of death, or total consumption. In your reading that would represent the end of her writing. That is a very powerful image -- imagining her writing until her last breath. 

By the way, I love your personal story about visiting her grave. I have been to Sylvia Plath's grave in England and I can appreciate the humility of being in that situation.

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
In her poem ""I taste a liquor never brewed"", Emily
Dickinson utilizes the feeling of being drunk as a tasteful yet effective
metaphor for the euphoria that she experiences in connection with the natural
world. The poemâ€™s form is true to the Dickinsonian tradition in that the lines
are well thought out and rather condensed, attempting to convey large (and
sometimes open-ended) ideas to the reader while using a limited and somewhat
abbreviated medium.

The opening line of the first stanza is where the poemâ€™s namesake is
derived from. It is also where Dickinson initially presents us with the conceit
of intoxication that endures throughout the entirety of the poem. It is
interesting to note that as a poet, Dickinson is often jumpy with her metaphors
and prone to abandoning conceits as quickly as she introduces them, so the fact
that the concept of being â€œdrunkâ€ on nature and the world around remains present
and intact for the duration of this piece despite being approached from a
variety of vantage points across itâ€™s course is definitely a matter of
significance worthy of the readerâ€™s attention. 

The rest of the first stanza uses comparison to convey just how
valuable her â€œliquorâ€ is in relation to some of the finest and most expensive
alcohols known to humanity. I believe the use of the word â€œneverâ€ in the
opening line to be of the most consequence to the tone of the piece, as it implies
that no human could possibly have the capability or capacity to create
something as beautiful and tangibly powerful as what she is experiencing via nature.


The second stanza runs with this idea, describing (with a very
positive tone) some of the finer origins of Dickinsonâ€™s drunkenness (the air,
the dew, the sky, and the summer). Within those same lines, she also makes use
of words that more often than not have a rather negative connotation
(inebriate, debauchee, and reeling). The resulting juxtaposition that is
created is indicative of Dickinsonâ€™s attention to detail and her mastery over
her craft. â€œInns of molten blueâ€ furthers this concept, as an inn, often portrayed
as the dimly lit, dreary home of lifetime drunks, is presented as a blue sky
with color so rich and deep that it appears to be burning. It bears a striking
resemblance to the image of â€œthe Gambrels of the Skyâ€, found earlier in our
readings within Dickinsonâ€™s poem â€œI dwell in possibilityâ€. 

The third stanza develops the idea that Dickinson will increase the
level of her inebriation off of nature over time, even more so after the
butterflies and the bees have ceased to drink from it themselves (a very funny
allusion to the insects and their pollination of flowers). With this stanza the
reader receives the notion that Dickinson may be rather critical of the culture
surrounding alcohol and bars, evoking images of landlords kicking drunken
patrons from their establishments and ex-drinkers recalling their love for
their booze. Nature is presented as the fairer of the two worlds. 

The final stanza posits imagery of saints and angels (who appear to
be engaging in their own drunken merriment) gazing down from the sky and
watching Dickinson as she drinks in nature. The final line, â€œLeaning against
the sun!â€ is a humorous one, as lean was used a slang term for alcohol in her
day. It draws this piece to a close on a warm and inviting note.

On itâ€™s surface, this poem appears lighthearted in tone and positive
in language, but upon closer pruning there is definitely a darker and more
serious social commentary that exists within its confines. Using some
biographical context, Dickinsonâ€™s professed love of the natural world in this
poem seems inspired in part by her distaste for human behavior and her own
introversion. Overall, itâ€™s an interesting and multifaceted work of art, and an
enjoyable read. Shout out to Emily D.

    For mesostics and essays written by students choosing Option A:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext (""seed text""), the spine, and the resulting mesostic? How does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtapositions?
    2. What does this essay have to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?
    For writing experiments and essays written by students choosing Option B:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing? Does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtaposition(s) between
        the original and the ""written-through"" experiment?
    2. Does the writer have something to say about this kind of ""writing through"" a previous text, or about aleatory or ""unoriginal"" poetry generally? Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?

I think the person that did this mesostic exercise did a good job in his exercise even though he does not understand what came out of it! He at least attempted to try it and see the results. I did not try it since I did not understand the directions to attempt it. He finds that the exercise does not have meaning to him even after reading it over ten times. If I do something more than five times I tend to give up on it. I think the exercise this essay writer did shows that sometimes what a writer does and what he gets in the results are two different matters. He mentions 2 words show up in the stanzas-channel and Kimmel. I know channel and Jimmy Kimmel is a network and Jimmy Kimmel appears on late night television on a channel. Perhaps, this is the connection to the mesostic. Interesting how William Blake's name gets scattered throughout the prose poem!

The essay doesn't say a whole lot about the stanzas, dashes, etc., and the writing could have used a bit of editing. However, it does do more than paraphrase the poem. The author also makes a very interesting observation at the end, when s/he says that 'she [ED] sounds more progressively tipsy the more she writes,' noting the use of the word 'reel' to prove his/her point.

1. This essay is, more or less, a paraphrase, albeit a well written one. 
2. There is no mention of dashes. I didn't notice that was a requirement of the closed reading. I am forgiving the author of the above writing for this ommission. It doesn't in my opinion affect the high quality of the close reading. 

3. Stanzas are discussed briefly and in order. There is no specific mention of the movement forward, inward, or otherwise in the essay .

4. Shifts in metaphor are not really dealt with in detail here. Again, I don't mind. I like the writing as it is. I guess we will all be getting more experience with the proper writing of these assignments as the course progresses. A more than decent first effort. :).

I like the style of this essay and the way it is organised, each paragraph dealing with certain part of the poem or certain aspect. I think the author caught the meaning of the poem. And the main point of the poem - the alcoholic metaphor is highlighted. I like the honesty in admitting that the meaning of certain parts of the poem are not clear for the author. The idea of Emily as a rebel is very interesting and the phrase ""she has reached there levels in heaven, not as a saint or a pure angel, but rather, through her sophisticated approach to mischief: as a â€œTipplerâ€ seems to me as a rather unexpected approach but - again - very, very interesting.  The explanation of the use of dashes -  almost like hiccups sounds very good.

Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Repeating the rules on the manifesto were nice to keep the essay on track. The ideas were great, but needed elaboration and to be thought through more. I think it would've spiced up the essay more with a few extra opinions of yours, and also by talking about how the form of the poem reflects imagist ideals. You talked briefly about the condensation and grammar of the piece, but could have developed ideas more on that. Overall, the essay was pretty good.

        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


I think you did a great job saying why he is a poet and not a painter. I feel like at times you were just restating the poem versus really looking between the lines for the meaning. But in the end, your conclusion does a nice job of explaining that he understands more about poetry than painting, good job!

Very clever and clear comparison between the Imagist manifesto and two versions. The advantage to compare the manifesto with two versions one by one, is that you hardly miss any important points, while the disadvantage is that you may not able to analyze the differences in a more systematic way, and at the same time you may miss the chance to explore something more beyond the manifesto. Anyway, I like this essay very much for its clarity and succinctness.

This essay hits most of the main points of the imagist approach and why the 2nd poem is more in that tradition, but does not deal with prepositions or the subjectivity issue.  The comments on the poem's visualization of the mother and child are especially perceptive and interesting.

Your conclusion is intriguing (O'Hara is not a painter merely because he is a poet) and I am enjoying mulling this over. You touch on the grammar (tenses) in the poem. You do not seem to discuss the metapoetic quality of the poem (nor did I!). Your discussion of the parallel but unique stories painting and poetry tells is very interesting. You do not mention the New York school, but it does not at all detract from your essay. It  may have been good to include some other specific lines from the poem that enabled you to reach your conclusion. Overall, a well rounded essay and a pleasure to read!

I think the exercise is very much in the writing of a short essay and learning to be succinct in a short word count and then in the marking of other peoples essays we each have to read five essays which of course assists our learning, Whatever our grading for our work makes no difference it is the knowledge that we gain from the exercise that is important. 2,500 words is not going to take as long as 5000!!!",3
1755,1367863493,"Thanks [REDACTED].  If it wasn't for the fact that I can't learn bupkiss unless I write it down myself, I'd sit back and enjoy Dr. [REDACTED]'s lectures and let you take notes for me.Since I'm often accused of seeing things as black or white, you'd think I could explain Structuralism (3.6) for it's core anchoring binary pair.  In fact, I thought I had the concept in Xenia (hospitable vs non-hospitable).  Then Dr. [REDACTED] said it would break down further into food/not food (since that's part of Xenia, too).  Even further is the food on the table the servant set next to your chair versus food handed to you by the host, torn from the best cut by his own hands.  I'm not sure this would cause the anxiety expected in the biological response to the binary, but it would certainly cause elation to be so honored.  Hopefully, colleagues will tell me if I'm off-base here.  It just seems to me that Structuralism may be a form of OCD trying to get to the smallest detail of binary opposites.   ",2

Is there any way to see if my essay has been submitted or if there was some sort of technical  error?",6
4008,1370098848,"I received an 8 for this work.  Very pleased with the evaluations.  I felt the challenge was to keep within the modest word count. This thread is an excellent addition to the evaluation system.  [REDACTED] Anon.Was Book 24 added later?  Initially this made sense.  After all, Book 23 is filled with conflict resolution:Penelope is told that Odysseus is home and the suitors are dead;Penelope tests Odysseus regarding his real identity;  Odysseus re-assumes his physical characteristics;  Penelope and Odysseus share their experiences over the past 20 years;  Penelope and Odysseus are more at ease with each other and â€œrevelâ€;  Odysseus, et al, go to visit Laertes and give him the happy news of Odysseusâ€™ return.But wait.  There is unfinished business:  The Ithacans have not yet learned of the death of their â€œisland princesâ€.  Once they discover this, they will be bent on revenge, a core value in ancient Greece.  For Homer's audience, Book 24 ties up the loose ends and furnishes the myth with a culturally logical conclusion.   The literary device of the ring opens Book 24, transporting the reader to the Land of Death, where the newly arrived suitorsâ€™ version of their demise is told.  Amphimedon reports to Agamemnon that â€clearly a god was driving him,â€ (p.474,ln.200) referring to Odysseus.  This realization, had it come to the suitors earlier, could have saved their lives.  The story then returns to Ithaca for the tale's resolution. Odysseus has survived with assistance from the gods, but also through his own combination of clever talk (escaping Polyphemus), strength of body and will (surviving Poseidon's violent storms), astute decisions (avoiding the traps of Scylla, Charybdis, and the Sirens), and through Athena's alliance (time and again she protects him).  All of these attributes are still at work through the myth's end. As the tale is woven, the Odyssey is rife with deceit, manipulation, lies, and suspicion.  In Books 23 and 24, when Odysseus returns to Ithaca, he lies to everyone about who he is. These lies are backed up by Telemachus and Eurycleia after they discover Odysseus is home.  His rags and physical transformation hide his real identity until it can safely be revealed. Penelope, suspicious of who this man really is, manipulates him into defending the origin of their bed.  Odysseus and his companions deceive the Ithacans after he slays the suitors, hoodwinking them into believing that there is a palace wedding celebration.  Even old Laertes is deceived by his sonâ€™s lies. Throughout the Odyssey, the gods intervene --- for good or evil.  Poseidon's power poses threats and delays.  Athena appears in various forms to protect and rescue Odysseus.  It is Athena and Zeus who supply the means for a satisfying conclusion to the story. In Book 24, following Zeusâ€™ instructions, Athena guides Odysseus' escape to Laertesâ€™ farm and restores the physicality of both Odysseus and Laertes.   Ending the story, Zeus issues a decree via Athena, which is obeyed, henceforth, by Odysseus and the Ithacans:  a pact is sealed; memories of the conflict are purged;  peace, friendship and wealth crest through the land.

I'm seeing a young man, facing 108 mocking suitors who are threatening both him and his father, should Odysseus return. I really tried to picture the situation, and for me, Telemachus is doing all he can--so even though the source I mention above may be scaled down, it's point is well taken; the SUITORS were like a disease. I just discovered that source http://www.maicar.com/GML in the Resources section of our Course Wiki, which has SO much information!Book 1: l. 445 refers to ""cool-headed Telemachus"", who amazes the suitors with his daring in standing up to them.Book 2: In the scene with the Ithacan assembly, l. 143 says ""with calm good sense, Telemachus replied...""l. 231, ""Telemachus answered, firm in his resolve.."" to follow Athena's direction about visiting Nestor and Menelaus. He says that, after a year, if he has not discovered what has happened to Odysseus, he will return and Penelope can marry.Mentor then supports Telemachus and rightfully points out that the problem lies with the suitors, ""weaving their violent work with all their wicked hearts."" l. 264. Mentor holds the assembly responsible for allowing the suitors to become an unruly mob--and of course is mocked by the suitors while the assembly stays quiet. l. 343 describes him as ""self-possessed Telemachus"" even though the suitors are mocking both him and Mentor.

It comes from the ""grey area"".Since I'm someone who tries to avoid seeing things as ""black or white"", I sort of dwell in the grey. This idea that the binary pair is based on biology makes the human brain sound like a computer to me. When he ended by saying that Structuralism says there is ONE binary pair at the core of each myth, I had to stop. To go ""binary hunting"", for me, would be to take the joy out of reading.

I guess that in this state of suspended animation she could not act as queen and order these layabouts away.  Where was her father in all of this, though?  He had the power to determine whether she should marry and to who.  I would think that since Odysseus had abdicated his role as king, husband and father for so long, her father would have had the right to determine who she should remarry or to order her to decide for herself.  It sounds as if he could have forced her hand so that there would be a king for Ithaca.  Maybe he could have named Telemachus as king, though he was really too young, both physically and mentally.  Sending Telemachus off on the quest to find out about his father seems to be really about getting him out of the way and keeping him from any harm that could have come from the suitors or a future substitute king.

And her grief over Odysseus is woven throughout the last chapters--even after 20 years, she has been loyal to him.In fact, I was touched by the several places where she begs Artemis to kill her with an arrow--just so she can be free of the grief in the first case, and so she won't have to marry one of the suitors in the other. But, like Odysseus when he contemplates suicide, she pulls herself together and carries on. The scene with the two of them by their bed made them so very human--testing each other out, and then finally reaching acceptance. 20 years! What a woman, unlike any other in the book.

3975,1370033568,"Thank you, [REDACTED], for bringing over your essay to
this thread so that we may expand our discussion on Functionalism.

Somewhere in the beginning of the essay, you may
have to say that you are using a Functionalist tool to consider the
relationship between the gods and the Greeks of Homeric times. Otherwise, to an
objective observer, the essay may sound like it is just describing the godsâ€™
behavior and the consequences of obeying/not obeying them.

You may also wish to consider these aspects:

1.     Ordinarily,
cattle were considered the best meat to eat, in terms of value and taste (to
those who eat meat). However, Heliosâ€™ cattle had been made sacred and so it is
a â€˜food crimeâ€™ to eat it. Odysseusâ€™ men had broken a sacrament. They had
offended the gods by breaking what may be considered the No. 1 Taboo of their
time.

2.     The
menâ€™s behavior also seemed flippant towards the gods. They ostensibly swore an
oath not to eat the cattle and immediately reversed position on it. They tried
to justify their actions by making token sacrifices/libations to the gods but
they did not seem sincere and did not make a greater effort to make the proper
offerings. Remember how Menelaus also suffered for not making proper
sacrifices.

All things said, your essay is quite well-written. The descriptions are very good, with judicious quotes from the book to back up your position. I am
curious to know, however, if your reviewers may have asked you to give more of
an analysis of how Functionalism works in this episode. ",2

4019,1370149204,"Here is my essay in answer to question #3 on Structuralism. I had to pare down the introduction and conclusion considerably  to make the word limit at exactly 550 words.Binary Opposition Expressed in the Arrival of Odysseus at Scheria
     Structural analysis consists of searching for details in the 
narrative of a myth that represent one aspect or another of a core 
cultural binary pair. In The Odyssey, book 5 (Fagles, 165-166),
 a naked Odysseus seeks shelter for the night after landing on the shore
 of Scheria. After setting out for the woods, Odysseus ""found a grove...
 beneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root, one olive wild, the
 other well-bred stock"" (Fagles, 167). The binary opposition revealed 
here is wild or primitive versus cultivated or civilized,
 a distinction basic to human culture. Only civilized cultures can 
produce cultivated crops and manufactured shelters. The olive tree of well-bred stock is an indication that the naked and starving, seemingly primitive, Odysseus has arrived in a land of civilized people.
Odysseus then crept beneath the bushes, ""scraping up at once a good 
wide bed for himself with both hands"" (Fagles, 167). He used his hands because he lacked the tools,
 the sign of a civilized man. Then, ""A fine litter of dead leaves had 
drifted in,"" meaning that he took advantage of the leaves drifting in rather than using tools
 like a rake or broom. Later, in book 23, Odysseus boasts of having made
 the bed in his own home with tools such the adze, auger and plumb line 
(Fagles, 462). This shows the contrast between Odysseus in his civilized
 prime and the primitive state to which he had been reduced when landing
 on Scheria.
Next morning (book 6) when Odysseus meets Nausicaa and her maids, he 
stripped ""a leafy branch from the tangled olive growth to shield his 
body, hide his private parts"" (Fagles, 172). He felt the embarrassment 
of a civilized man being naked in society, but he had to use the wild covering of a branch rather than a manufactured garment.
The distinction between wild and civilized continues (page 172) with 
this comparison of Odysseus to an animal who preys, not only on other 
wild animals, but also on flocks and homesteads, the products of 
civilization:

 ... And out he stalked
as  a mountain lion exultant in his power
strides through wind and rain and his eyes blaze
and he charges sheep or oxen or chases wild deer
but his hunger drives him on to go for flocks,
even to raid the best-defended homestead.

The reference to the ""best-defended homestead"" may be pointing ahead 
 to his future destruction of the suitors, during which he has to act 
with animalistic violence.
Nausicaa's answer to Odysseus' introduction is to welcome him to 
civilized society and offer him clothing: ""But now, seeing you've 
reached our city and our land, you'll never lack for clothing..."" 
(Fagles, 174). She mentions clothing even before she offers him food. 
The handmaidens lay out a cloak and shirt for him and a flask of olive 
oil, a product of the cultivated olive tree, to rub on his skin. When he
 appears to Nausicaa fully bathed and clothed she responds (p 176), ""now
 he seems like a god who rules the skies up there!... give the stranger 
food and drink, my girls."" Only when Odysseus appears presentable can he
 be accepted into civilized society and be given food and drink.",2

856,1367058983,"Hello [REDACTED]. I'm glad you asked that question. I believe things are a bit more complicated.Let's start with the baby Astyanax. The only reason he was killed was because the Achaeans knew that when he grew up he would seek revenge, and this way they prevented that. I'm not justifying the act, just explaining the reasoning. It was one of those cruel war-acts that had to be done.As for Sparta, they never killed sick babies. On the contrary, they grew up to become citizens. In fact, one of kings of Sparta, Agisilaos, was born with one leg disformed, but that didn't stop the Spartans for having him as a king. Also, there is a very nice story about a Spartan soldier who was getting ready to fight alongside the other Spartans, but the others were making fun of him and told him he couldn't fight since he didn't have legs. To that he answered: ""you only need legs if you are going to abandon the battle"". Another soldier was blind and when the others told him not to fight he answered ""if I'm in the battlefield, even if I don't do anything there is always the possibility that my knife will find the enemy"".These stories show that the killing of sick children was a fairy-tale and never really happened. But more importantly, archaeological excavations of the area have only found bones that belong to adults, probably enemies or criminals sentenced to death. No trace of infands or children being killed in Sparta.",2

3751,1369699698,"Dear [REDACTED],I'm not sure this will answer your question, but I wanted to expand the idea of misogyny a bit. There are several ways to understand Hesiod's positioning of women in his text: we might return to the generations of the gods, where in the first generation Gaia gives birth on her own, and, in the last generation, Zeus gives birth to Athena, and she takes the side of men from then onwards (we'll see this in Aeschylus' ""Furies""). One of the fears at the basis of these myths is the fear of a father that his child is not actually his: without DNA testing, how can you know for sure? If a woman stays in the house, she depletes all the man's goods; if she goes out of the house, how do we know she stays faithful? We get the story of Pandora, who opens her jar of evils, and hope alone is left inside. We might read the jar as a metaphorical womb, and the hope as the hope of legitimate children... but maybe that is going too far. What is interesting to me is that, without two parents in the generations of gods, there is no strife; with two parents comes rivalry and fighting and usurpation of power, eventually, Zeus claiming his patrimony as king of the gods, and putting an end to the fighting. So, is it misogynistic? Or an exploration of fears about fatherhood? Or fears about losing control? Happy to talk about Hesiod and women on Thursday, but I'm curious to expand the argument and maybe get into the hymns as well...",2
2564,1368719955,"I am very tempted to approach the assignment from the structuralist point of view, but I feel that it's the most knotty--and complicated--question.  Try as I might, I suspect my word count would be way off and my methodology not consistent with formal understanding of structuralism and anthropology.  How to pick just one episode??  Therefore it appears that functionalism will win out.  Personally, I wouldn't put to much stock in the notion of gods not ""being human"" and therefore not subject to biological concerns.  To me: biology refers to basic human needs (and the gods are representationally human--not animals, for example).  Basic human needs are things like food, kinship and sex.  For example: How can the father-child relationship be viewed from the point of Zeus and any of his many offspring.  Just pick one episode that has oppositional imagery and analyze the heck out of it.  From my understanding it's all about imagery and metaphor.  Warning:  I could be WRONG--that's why I've given up on structuralism. [REDACTED], is there one episode that spoke to you in some way--either behavior that made sense or didn't.  Return to it and see if a functionalist reading can be pulled out of it.  It's important to just keep it to one episode for coherency and brevity.  If my understanding",3
1163,1367296655,"For me, the Greek frame of orientation which allows men to weep makes them more human. Achilles' agony over Patrocles' death is overwhelming, and now Odysseus tries to stifle his tears, but Alcinous notices. This Brodsky poem carries some of that humanity that lets me care about these men as they show some vulnerability. Suffering can never truly be shared--but it can be allowed its time.

I can't remember how the war came out; even how old you are--I can't remember.Grow up, then, my Telemachus, grow strong. Only the gods know if we'll see each other again. You've long since ceased to be that babe before whom I reined in the plowing bullocks. Had it not been for Palamedes' trick*we two would still be living in one household. But maybe he was right; away from me you are quite safe from all Oedipal passions, and your dreams, my Telemachus, are blameless.http://www.poets.org/m/dsp_poem.php?prmMID=15205* ""King Odysseus did not want to follow the Achaians to war, so
he simulated that he was mad, and began cultivating a field with salt. Palamedes,

What we know and consider to be ancient Greek culture is really a specific time period in Athens which is well after the time we are talking about in terms of The Odyssey.  Homer is not telling a contemporary story to his audience.  It is a tale of a time before when he is recounting it.  We also have to assume that, while technically Odysseus' estate would go to Telemachus, there is an almost certain possibility that whoever married Penelope would kill Telemachus to seize control of the fortune.Also in terms of rejecting the suitors, that power would still likely lie with her father or in the absence of her father, her former father-in-law who had essentially retreated from the house.

You say that the characters of THE ILIAD and THE ODYSSEY ""understood that there were greater forces than themselves at work.""

The sense of Awe you mention comes from the recognition of something greater than we are--whether the natural world itself or the stars, as well as gods. And you ask what is, for me, a key question: ""What would this sort of thought matrix do to us, if we could carry such a point of view?"" I would hope that Awe is still a basic part of what it means to be human--but I'm wondering if the harnessing of technology has led to some hubris on the part of ""advanced"" humanity. The professor defined Awe as ""fear plus wonder""--but what happens in a society that tries to avoid fear as much as possible? Or tames that fear by putting it onto movie screens where the fear is just vicarious, not visceral?I've just posted a thread in the Homer forum for works inspired by THE ODYSSEY, and my first entry is the poem ""Ulysses"" by Tennyson. The last lines of the poem show the need to face the fear of the unknown up through the end of our lives. As Ulysses gets ready to leave with his old crew, sailing into the unknown, he says:Though much is taken, much abides; and though We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are--- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

3738,1369686254,"I would appreciate your feedback as I am disappointed with my evaluations.The question I have chosen is number three; â€œPropose an answer to the question of what binary opposition lies underneath this part of the story and provides the best insight into what is really at stake in it.â€ The question is based upon structuralist binaries. The structuralist method of analyzing literature is accomplished by contrasting the binary or two opposites of written pieces typically using the most rudimentary parts of the human experience. Examples would be two men; where one is hot and the other is cold or one is thin and the other is fat. In my structural analysis I understand I need look for repetitions, patterns, echoes, and oppositions in people, places, language, objects, movement, and decisions.The answer to the posed question of what binary opposition lies underneath this part of the story and provides the best insight into what is really at stake in it. Odysseus and the Cyclops are in binary opposition to one another and their contrasting differences lie beneath the book The Odyssey, Book 9 story titled: In the One-eyed Giants Cave. The following binarystructural analysis attempts show the implications of repetitions and oppositions by exploring the relationships of similarity and difference that link the storyâ€™s events and the actions of Odysseus and Cyclops..Odysseus and the Cyclops are both ruthless men but opposites; Odysseus is smooth, cunning and quick and the Cyclops rough, oafish, and plodding.  Odysseus is a liar saying â€œsince we chanced on youâ€. Odysseus â€œchancedâ€ upon no one having knowingly sailed up to what he knew to be Cyclopsâ€™s island, anchored, and marched ashore looking for food. Odysseus was plotting to steal the Cyclopsâ€™s food: â€œLetâ€™s make away with the cheeses, then come backâ€ at the same time asking the Cyclops for Xenia or hospitality saying â€œweâ€™re at your knees, in hopes of a warm welcomeâ€.  The Cyclops grumbles; â€œWe Cyclops never blink at Zeusâ€ and â€œIâ€™d never spare you in fear of Zeusâ€™s hatredâ€. The Cyclops having no reply from Odysseus the â€œruthless bruteâ€ snatches two of Odysseusâ€™s men and eats them. Odysseus continues to lie to the Cyclops by responding â€œSo, you ask me the name I am known by, Cyclops?â€ Odysseus says in answer to his rhetorical question: â€œNobody----thatâ€™s my nameâ€. The Cyclops â€œboomed back from his ruthless heartâ€ â€œNobody? Iâ€™ll eat Nobody last of all his friendsâ€Finally to conclude with the textâ€™s function, not its meaning, as the text's function is its meaning. The function of the text is to contrast the two opponentâ€™s styles, Odysseus and Cyclops, both of whom are very dangerous individuals. To make their escape Odysseus is perfectly willing to lie even badger Cyclops getting him drunk to put his eye out. Cyclops responds the only way he understands with brute force and outrageous cannibalistic behavior. The textâ€™s function is to show Odysseus triumphant over Cyclops as good, (maybe not too good), over evil.

1052,1367200285,"My theory is a vast cruel oversimplification of this very complex issue, but our times are different then Homeric times.  We fortunately in the US and Europe had not seen many major wars recently.  Even the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which left many war weary, only involved a part of our population (although the average Afghan and Iraqi would have completely different perspective and suffered much more).   Ancient days were rougher.  War was a way of live back then.  Every able-bodied landowner in Greece was a literal militia man, he owned a sword and shield and served in military service.  Back in the time of the Illiad, war was an even bigger fact of life, invasions occurred often and it was a particularly bad time of wars and political upheavals.  Many entire civilizations were wiped out (like the Hittites) or suffered severe times of war and invasion.  Heck, the Mycenaean civilization of Agamemnon would be gone merely several decades later.  Troy was just another wiped out city amongst many at the time.  The ancient version of the ""liberation of Iraq"" would have involved the killing of the majority of Baghdad population.   If PTSD existed, then many a people suffered it, so many it was a ""way of life"" and just was abnormal as tall individuals in a NBA locker room, and I do not think anyone would have discussed it if they had it.

679,1366921052,"This site has the clearest explanation I could find of both Telemachus and Penelope and their reaction to the suitors. Telemachus DID try to get rid of them with the Ithacan assembly, but even with his father's friend Mentor speaking out against the relatives of the suitors. These egotistical young men, ""the pride of Ithacan nobility"", did as they pleased right in front of not only their parents but the Ithacan assembly! And what they pleased was not only to harrass Penelope but plot to kill Odysseus if he SHOULD return, and even take the life of Telemachus. This is bullying to the nth degree, with no one supporting Penelope and Telemachus. http://www.maicar.com/GML/SUITORSPENELOPE.htmlThe SUITORS were like a disease 
Now, the reasonable way was for the SUITORS to be off, each to 
his own place, and conduct the suit from their own homes. And that is why Telemachus proposed them to feast themselves 
elsewhere, giving them formal notice to quit his palace in front of the Ithacan 
assembly. For Telemachus saw these young men who 
pestered his mother with unwanted attentions and wasted his wealth as a disease 
and an outrage to decency. But the SUITORS, who were the pride of Ithacan 
nobility, could not see any wrong in courting the widow of a dead king. And it 
was her, they argued, who had forced them to act as they did. For she had fooled 
them during three years with The Shroud of Laertes, saying that she would marry 
once she had finished this piece of work. But she, deceiving everybody, 
unravelled by night what she wove by day, and so, they reasoned, in order to 
avoid to be fooled again, they would have to stay and undermine the palace's 
finances until she decided to abandon her reluctant attitude. These were the 
means by which the SUITORS expected to force Penelope to make a choice, and by letting Telemachus suffer and see his wealth consumed, they 
hoped that he would persuade his mother to marry one of them....

And that is why Odysseus' old friend 
Mentor did not pick a quarrel at the 
Ithacan assembly with these unexperienced youths, but instead he admonished the 
citizens of Ithaca and the SUITORS' relatives for their acquiescent attitude. 
...And since nobody among those who counted for the 
SUITORS, condemned or admonished them, they dared to push their luck even 
further, declaring that if Odysseus would suddenly 
appear he would meet an ugly end, which means that from thoughtless SUITORS they 
were turning into rebels and instigators of rebellion. ... And once the SUITORS started thinking 
this last thought, it was not difficult for them to go even further and plot, 
although in vain, against the life of Telemachus,""

528,1366816824,"In the Geneology of Morals, Nietzsche has a section on this
worth quoting at length:

â€œâ€¦

That the conception of the gods in itself need not lead to the degradation of the imagination that
we had to consider briefly, that there are nobler
uses for the invention of the gods than for the self-crucifixion and  self-violation of man in which Europe over the
past millennia achieved its distinctive mastery- that is fortunately revealed
even by a mere glance at the Greek gods,
those reflections of noble and autocratic men, in whom the animal in man felt deified and  did not lacerate
itself,  did not rage against itself! For the longest time these Greeks used
their gods precisely so as to ward off the â€˜bad conscienceâ€™, so as to be able
to rejoice in their freedom of soul- the very opposite of the use to which
Christianity put its God. They went very
far in this direction, these splendid and lion-hearted children; and no
less an authority than the Homeric Zeus himself occasionally gives them to
understand that they are making things too easy for themselves. â€˜â€™Strange!â€ he
says once- the case is that of Aegisthus, a very
bad case-

Strange how these
morals so loudly complain of the gods!

We along produce evil,
they say; yet themselves

Make themselves
wretches through folly, even counter to fate. 

Yet one can see and hear how even this Olympian spectator
and judge is far from holding a grudge against them or thinking ill of them on
that account: â€˜how foolish they are!â€™
he thinks when he observes the misdeeds of mortals- and â€˜foolishnessâ€™, â€˜follyâ€™,
a little  â€˜disturbance in the head,â€™ this
much even the Greeks of the strongest, bravest age conceded of themselves as
the reason for much that was bad and calamitous- foolishness, not sin! Do you grasp that?

Even this disturbance in the head, however, presented a
problem: â€˜how is it possible? How could it actually have happened to heads such
as we have, we men of aristocratic
descent, of the best society, happy, well-constituted, noble, and virtuous?â€™-
thus noble Greeks asked themselves for centuries in the face of every
incomprehensible atrocity or wantonness with which one of their kind had
polluted himself. â€˜He must have been deluded by a god â€™ the concluded finally, shaking their headsâ€¦This expedient is typical of the Greeksâ€¦In this way the
gods served in those days to justify man to a certain extent even in his wickedness,
they served as the originators of evil- in those days they took upon
themselves, not the punishment but, what is nobler,
the guilt.""",2

3737,1369686218,"THE LAST CHAPTER
Homerâ€™s The Odyssey chronicles a soldierâ€™s journey home from fighting abroad.  Some scholars claim the final Book 24 was added by a later editor (Struck, Lecture 4.8).  Despite these assertions, the last chapter perfectly wraps up the anti-war statement Homer makes throughout his saga. 

Homer shows objection to war by depicting consequences from Odysseusâ€™ participation in the Trojan War.  The poem opens with a direct correlation of war and impending misfortune: â€œDriven time and again off course once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troyâ€¦many pain he suffered heartsickâ€¦ fighting to save his life and bring his comrades homeâ€ (Fagles, 77).  Odysseus fights for his life, suffers pain and heartsickness, and watches all his comrades die.  Odysseusâ€™ family suffers hardship as well:  Odysseusâ€™ son has a â€œheart obsessed with griefâ€ (Fagles, 81); Odysseusâ€™ wife is full of â€œunforgettable griefâ€ (Fagles, 88); His mother â€œdied of griefâ€ and; His father has a â€œheart racked with sorrowâ€ (Fagles 330).  Odysseus, and everyone he cares about, is negatively affected.

In addition to emotional tolls, Odysseusâ€™ property is depleted by suitors who overtake his house and court his wife in his absence (Fagles, 85).  By Book 5, Odysseus literally loses everything, except life, when he barely escapes a shipwreck, washing up on the island of Phaeacia (Fagles, 166).  Odysseus is completely alone, naked, and in need of everything to survive (Fagles, 174).  Accordingly, it is no coincidence that Odysseusâ€™ final stop introduces him to a peaceful society, thriving without war.

Through Phaeacia, Homer proposes another way to live.  Odysseus is told: â€œPhaeacians... care nothing for bow or quiverâ€ (Fagles, 176).  Unlike Odysseus, a master with weaponry (Fagles, 427),  Phaeacians donâ€™t use weapons.  This is also a place flourishing with a burgeoning city center, water resources, endless crops and plant life.  Odysseus observes: â€œTreesâ€¦ always in prime, pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red, succulent figs and olives swellingâ€¦ harvest all year roundâ€¦. a teeming vineyardâ€¦ greens of every kindâ€¦two springsâ€¦balanced shipsâ€¦meeting groundsâ€¦â€ (Fagles, 183).  If war represents death and destruction, then everything about Phaeacia represents life and creation.  Odysseus sees that a society which rejects war is superior.

Finally, in Book 24, Homer gives his protagonist an opportunity to apply what he has learned from his experiences. After Odysseus kills the suitors, their families swear revenge (Fagles, 481).  Odysseus prepares for war again, when Athena, Odysseusâ€™ guide, asks him to reconsider. She urges: â€œHold back now! Call a halt to the great leveler, Warâ€ (Fagles, 485).  After all he has gone through, Odysseus chooses not to fight.  Homer imparts: â€œHe obeyed her, glad at heart.  And Athena handed down her pacts of peace between both sides for all the years to comeâ€ (Fagles, 485).  By choosing not to battle, Odysseus and Ithaca are rewarded.

Since previous books discuss repercussions of war and Book 24 brings peace, it concludes Homerâ€™s anti-war sentiments and provides evidence this was Homerâ€™s intended ending for his epic.  He used his poetry to make is views of war known and to advocate for diplomacy and peace.

1514,1367600067,"[REDACTED]: I personally can't talk to the claim that there where no priestly group in Ancient Greece. I'm sure Prof. [REDACTED] has his reasons for saying this, but it could be that it's a simplification of saying that there where priests and priestesses, but they didn't have much power in society (like they did in other parts of the world). My source also talks about that being the general understanding, but she raises the question if we should reconsider this notion, seeing how highly valued parts of meat and what quantities they got.







""That the priests and priestesses were given such quantities of meat is somewhat surprising. Greek religious personnel did not occupy a particularly prominent position within Greek cult, if compared with priesthoods in other cultures and periods. The presence of a priest of priestess was not even required at a sacrifice within a sanctuary and, in contrast to Near Eastern practice, for example, it was the group and not the priest who made the offerings to the gods. Greek priests did not form priestly colleges like their Roman counterparts, and they had not distinct codifying power over ritual, or any political influence. In fact, one of the characteristics of Greek priesthoods has been defined as their lack of power and influence. However, the fact that they did receive so much meat, including the parts given to the gods, should perhaps lead us to reconsider the notion of Greek priests and priestesses as not occupying a particularly prominent position. If we look upon Greek priest and priestesses from the point of view of meat distribution, and this is not an insignificant perspective in this context, they were of great importance and held high status. It is possible that we may not yet have fully grasped the significance of priest and priestesses in Greek religion.""

3063,1369048413,"Wow. I guess it's the teacher in me, but [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], I remember ALL the furor in F&amp;SF about NOT having a ""0"" option for plagiarism. Sorry, but as an educator, I stick with the idea that plagiarism is stealing and cheating. Plain and simple. What I agree with is that WE shouldn't be the ones to assess an essay suspected of being plagiarized. That's the job of the professor and the TA's. So I'm not sure how that can be reported--but to treat a plagiarized essay the same way others are treated--people who really DID their work--is simply not right.This thread--with people I really respect and admire--has definitely made up my mind NOT to do the second essay. If plagiarism is allowed simply because ""it doesn't matter"", then I will not participate in a peer response system that lets stealing and cheating slide.I'm sick at heart that this has ALREADY come up--and for me, the issue is the whole ""grading"" business. I'm NOT going to repeat all the lengthy discussions we had in F&amp;SF. However, I still maintain that our essay threads--where people simply posted their essays for responses--were a wonderful way to share ideas. We could read the work of many more than five students, and simply offer comments. [REDACTED], everyone has to make their own decision, but I disagree with one comment you make: ""After all, no kittens will be harmed by someone submitting a plagiarised essay for an online course."" True, thank heaven. However, when I caught a straight ""A"" student plagiarizing in his senior year and reported it, he was suspended for 3 days and lost his grade point average. I'll never forget that he came and thanked me for showing him what integrity meant. I had been heartsick--but his reponse has guided me ever since. ",4

1356,1367446805,"I am always so curious about the contradiction that men in these older times/stories seem to put women on a pedestal and yet treat them like property and without any rights? Throughout the Odyssey we see lots of helpful, positive female characters. Penelope is faithful to Odysseus and wont remarry. She is cunning in her weaving and unweaving of her endless web. Helen is beautiful, magical, has the ability to take away pain with her potions and is a good hostess and entertainer. Calypso lives in a natural world, she exemplifies sex, passion, love, youth, beauty, vitality.  And while told by the Gods to let Odysseus go against her will she is essential in helping him leave by pointing out the best trees and giving him tools to build his raft. Then we have Nausicaa who is young, beautiful, a virgin, obediently washing everyone&#39;s clothes doing her duty who  will assist Odysseus as well. Lets not forget Athena, Odysseus&#39; savior who master minds every step of his safe return home and acts as a guide home. There are &quot;great&quot; women everywhere and they are almost all described as beautiful. Perhaps Homer was a ladies&#39; man? Women help the male heroes of our story at every turn. And Odysseus suggests he wants men and women to coexist happily. 
p. 174 &quot;No, finer, greater gift in the world than that...when man and woman possess their home, two minds, two hearts that work as one.&quot;
But do we really see scenarios where men and women are on the same page? where women have equal footing? It seems they have duties, roles, support men. Penelope&#39;s husband is gone and the suitors plague her. Theres also talk of sending her back to her father. Her home isnt her own. Calypso loves Odysseus. He sleeps with her but he doesnt love her back. Helen tries to leave Menelaus for Paris and he launches a war to get her back bc she&#39;s his.

state of both fear but also wonder at the world around them. So for him, myth
is not just fear-based irrationalityâ€¦â€

Q2            -&gt;  ""What is considered the
â€œmodern eraâ€ in this course?""


L1.4         -&gt;   ""...anything
in the modern era counts as Renaissance and forward for our course."" 

A2            -&gt; 
""anything after the middle ages""



Upon review, I think that's the issue and the place where things become a
little murky, because of course the Renaissance came after the middle ages, but
that is not the way it was defined in lecture 1.4. 

In any event, these are small points in the overall context
of this wonderful course. However, I do have to wonder and possibly even
proceed with a bit of trepidation when I consider what are likely to be the
more complex question-sets we are likely to encounter in the weeks ahead. 

Again, thank you very much for responding to my query and
for helping me to think it through.

As one of the more  resonant myths for modern children, she and her mother have a special place in my heart.  I was surprised to read Hesiod's description of her as  ""greatly feared"" (lines 767-774) and Homer described her as ""the almighty god of death and dread Persephone"" (book 10 line 588) and later as a ""great Queen"" who sends up wraiths who deceive Penelope.  The Homeric Hymn to Demeter corresponds to the profound story I knew.  Do you have a sense of how Persephone was typically considered by the Greeks?  In other myths is she hardened by her yearly return to Hades, becoming a shadow of joyous girl?On another note, I thought it interesting that Demeter (disguised as an old woman) asked to be served a drink made with pennyroyal--an ancient herb known to cause miscarriages.

4897,1407019734,"OK, maybe I've been a bit obsessive about looking into this...
I've now found a couple of references that state the shoulder of a sacrificial animal was the portion of the king - which fits with a 'shoulder' being given to Pelops by the goddess Demeter, and his own future status as king.
It can also relate to the ability to carry (shoulder) something - the power and strength to 'bring into being' - kingly characteristics; and apt for Pelops bringing the Peloponnesus Kingdom into being (he is an ancestral figure).
Not completely sure about ivory - the link with falsehood doesn't really seem to fit with kingly power?
However, I've come across another source (Dictionary of Symbols) which quotes Pliny as saying 'Ivory preserves the body from all decay'. This seems to fit better with Demeter, who is linked with fertility and life.
So - maybe a functionalist myth, legitimising the self-image of Pelops' descendants: a kingdom and dynasty, blessed by the gods, which will not decay

4754,1406749086,"I love this topic, thanks for bringing it up.Ã‚Â  The concept of ""predictive programming"" is related here, in our modern day: it's the deliberate use of media of all types by elites (opinion-leaders, political leaders, business leaders, etc.)Ã‚Â  who are interested in influencing large numbers of people to becoming accustomed to certain as-yet-unknown or new concepts, procedures, technologies, etc.Ã‚Â  You could, I'm sure, find better definitions online.Ã‚Â  Who wrote these plays we are reading?Ã‚Â  Educated male citizens.Ã‚Â  And who was in the audience?Ã‚Â  Educated male citizens.Ã‚Â  (Did women attend??Ã‚Â  I'd like to know!)Ã‚Â  So whose interests were being catered to and molded, and whose worldview was being represented and influenced?Ã‚Â  The only people who mattered.Ã‚Â  I think this is why these plays show us a world where women are not associated with hearth and home:Ã‚Â  children are raised by nurses, mothers allow their babies to be killed (Jocasta), or are murdered for avenging the death of their children (Clytemnestra), or indeed murder their own children (Agave).Ã‚Â  Or, they remain faithful to philandering spouses and quietly tend to their duties (Penelope.)Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  In a functionalist/""predictive programming"" reading, these are the values or points-of-view that the educated male audience is supposed to regard as normal.Ã‚Â  It was, after all, the mindset necessary to maintain the power structure as it existed.Ã‚Â  It seems to be consensus-building through entertainment.But what did the women think?Ã‚Â  My guess is that they didn't write (any known) plays because they were too busy tending to hearth and home.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  As fascinating as it all is, I am more interested in exploring this

5076,1407382180,"As I am reading Book 6 of ""The Aeneid,"" it's very clear that a good part of Vergil's motivation for writing his work is to keep a good relationship with his sponsor, Augustus - not something that artists have not had to do throughout the ages, so he wouldn't be the first.
However, when we do compare him to Homer, it seems as if Homer wasn't quite as hampered by this artistic limitation. In this sense, doesn't it seem as if Homer was perhaps truer to his vision than Vergil? Homer seemed to ""write,"" or rather recite, to entertain and transmit certain values, but he wasn't doing it to serve one particular emperor. 
It's just so blatantly obvious in Book 6 of ""The Aeneid"" it's as if Vergil is hitting you over the head with a hammer - or a shovel!

I am not sure I agree with Professor [REDACTED] that this monster is necessarily the same one that Zeus slew in his senior year at Sky God University, by Hesiod's account - or if it is, the story is different enough that this monster's demise at Zeus' hands is not a foregone conclusion.",3

They were also plotting to kill Telemachus! According to Zeus, most of this was arranged by Athena anyway (early on in Book 5) so arguably it was ordained that Odysseus would kick the suitors' butts.Agamemnon's warning was not just about Penelope but about the suitors and the general dangers he (and anybody with him) could face on their return home. In Book 11, Odysseus also learns from his mother that Penelope has not remarried and is waiting for him. Wouldn't she have warned Odysseus if Penelope was plotting against him? I suspect that Odysseus had no worries about Penelope's loyalty but perhaps he was concerned that if he came home openly that the suitors would kill Penelope and seize his property and position?And from the point of view that it is an epic, it would be a bit of a damp squid if Odysseus just went home openly, looked sternly at the suitors and the suitors said, ""Ooops, sorry pal, here's some money and sheep, we're going sorry!""I do agree to a large extent that Odysseus is a bit of a plonker (for example, telling the cyclops his name and address!).

1599,1403043076,"All right. I'm going there....where even Homer seems to fear to tread....Here's a different reading of Penelope which I can't get out of my head, and which is based on a close reading of these 1st 8 books in the Fagles translation. I'm not at all claiming that it's ""right"" - I don't think such a thing ever exists in the interpretation of poetry, it's simply my reading of the words. It's more an exploration than an interpretation, I suppose.The suitors are described, again and again, as eating and drinking Odysseus's (and Telemachus's) entire household contents:Page 84-85 Athena speaks:""What's this banqueting....Some wedding-feast, some festival?....Hardly a potluck supper, I would say.....gorging in your house.""But we all know the topic of conversation here -- it's not a problem with food supply, it's sexual politics. A wedding-feast (as so aptly mentioned by Athena) points to a wedding bed and consensual sex...love. The sex which may or may not be happening in Odysseus's house while he is away is about power and lust - appetite, not love.What is Telemachus's view of his mother's sexuality?He brings her fidelity into question several times:Page 84, line 249 ""Mother has always told me I'm his son, it's true, but I am not so certain.""Page 85, line 289 ""And Mother...she neither rejects a marriage she despises nor can she bear to bring the courting to an end - while they continue to bleed my household white.""Although in public he sticks to the respectful line, page 95, line 55 ""Suitors plague my mother - against her will -""Then, look at his words to Penelope on page 88, line 400:""Bards are not to blame --Zeus is to blame.""Hmmm....the fact that Homer (?) Fagles (?) split that line makes me wonder if Telemachus was about to blame his mother, but then remembered where he was and did a quick switch to Zeus. In any case, Penelope ""took to heart the clear good sense in what her son had said."" and Homer then describes him as ""discreet Telemachus"".Does Penelope blame herself as well??But Telemachus is young, naive and confused. He has no father to guide him and teach him what is right or wrong in the treatment of women, so we need to keep that in mind.The suitors, of course, blame Penelope and label her ""the matchless queen of cunning"", but we can't take that seriously....sounds like an excuse for bad behaviour (although, granted, that's coming from the perspective of 2014).***However, the following is very serious indeed:Page 96, line 120: ""we caught her in the act - unweaving her gorgeous web. So she finished it off. Against her will. We forced her.""Penelope weaves TOWARDS something, towards Laertes' death (as she's making his shroud). What does that mean? If she accepts one of the suitors, it is a proclamation of Odysseus's death and would kill Laertes...perhaps?But wait.....she's also weaving TOWARDS having sex with a man other than her husband, another kind of death - death of marriage, death of Laertes' royal line (?), and a different death altogether -- sexual, appetitious and something more akin to Calypso's life than Penelope's.But it all comes to a startling, horrifying end. The men ""finished it off"". My blood runs cold at those words. Was she raped? What else could that line refer to? And so is the problem now that, even after being raped, she still refuses to marry one of them?",3

Regarding the efforts of translations: language is a living thing it evolves with the times and the culture. The work of the translator is not merely to translate literally, but to make the words come alive to the present day reader while maintaining the spirit, rhyme, meaning, and power of the original. In other words to make it important to you, 3 thousand years later as it was to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. Yes, these works were written a long time ago and have entered the public domain, however, it is the original Greek and Latin that are in the public domain and probably any translations that were published before 1923. 
It takes considerable effort, education, time, and a love of ancient languages to bring us the beauty and raw drama of the past. Everyone, I think will admit some translations are better than others.

As I've understood it so far, structuralism is about a core binary underpinning a myth - producing an overarching theme. Such themes are also of fundamental importance relating to basic biology or survival, as these are core concerns of humans.
However, they are surely going to be expressed in a way that emphasises the particular core values, beliefs and concerns of the intended audience - that is, functionalism.
And the particular core values, beliefs and concerns of the intended audience are in turn built upon general factors of fundamental human importance relating to basic biology or survival - that is, structuralism.
And both in turn are best understood by knowing and understanding the context of the time and of the people concerned.  There are some universal myths and widespread motifs, but often if we don't know or understand the history, geography, lifeways etc of the people we run a real risk of totally misunderstanding the meanings. 
This all seems a circular process.  I'm not at all sure we can separate functionalism and structuralism - what do others think?

4661,1406589653,"a couple of thoughts on reading the Eumenides:
Athena declares the issue of determining the guilt or otherwise of Orestes to be too big a problem for her, as either 'solution' could be potentially disastrous in the long run - so she hands it over to humans (albeit retaining a casting vote). Could this be a sign of increasing self-confidence of the Athenian humans, not needing the gods quite so much?
Once traditional blood-feuds are 'officially' disallowed, in favour of the open trials initiated by Athena, steps need to be taken to fully imbed the new order. Without this step, blood feuds would simply go 'underground', ie carry on unofficially, with disastrous consequences for society as a whole - reflected in the Furies' threats to go underground and destroy the life-giving seeds and plants from below the earth.
It's interesting that Athena draws on female principles to prevent this. The new, positive, life-giving energies of the Furies (now the Kindly Ones) are strongly related to the female, and it is women who are called upon in the play's climax to honour this. It seems that human women are being called upon to force society to move away from old and essentially self-destructive blood-feuds, in favour of the new kind of justice.
The sense that bloodshed could continue abroad, away from the homeland, seems both a sop to potentially aggressive males, and also an acknowledgment that bloodlust cannot be totally wiped out - only controlled as well as it can be, and totally forbidden at 'home', ie within the city and state.

4816,1406846993,"OK, thinking out loud, but here goes:
The Oedipus story seems much older than Sophocles.  If I remember rightly, Oedipus is mentioned by Homer as having committed incest with his mother, whose name was given there as similar to that of Jocasta.  However, that Oedipus did not come to disaster, but continued to rule long and well.
Taken together with the 'earth-born' aspects, I wonder if the 'incest' was originally a sacred 'marriage' between the King and (a representative of) the (mother) goddess, to ensure the fertility of the land.
Such 'sacred marriages' are attested in a number of early cultures, including ancient Egypt, although details vary. 
If so, it's easy to see how later cultures, who no longer practise this ritual, could have misinterpreted old stories of such 'sacred marriages' as actual human incest, between the king and his human mother, rather than (the representative of) the mother goddess. It would also explain why Oedipus, despite his blindness, is regarded as inherently good. 
Currently, I'm thinking Sophocles took an old myth (plus other mythic elements), and applied them to suit the contemporary situation in Athens (such as the aftermath of plague).
As for Laius, the confrontation at the crossroads could reflect a power struggle between an aged king, and a potential new claimant; neither prepared to give way to the other - a situation which could only end in the death of one or both of them.
In this scenario, Laius would in his (earlier) turn have also undergone a similar sacred marriage with (a representative of) the same (mother) goddess.  Again, one could see how this could have been later misinterpreted, such that he came to be considered the previous husband of the 'mother' (goddess) of Oedipus, ie Oedipus' father.
Just a thought.

My journey has taught me that all things, however, are truly connected and behind all of it there is truly ONE story. Myth and Religion may function differently on the surface, but their story is a human story. Both speak to our unconscious, our spirit if you will. When you zoom out and look at them you begin to see how similar they are throughout time and space (Creation Myths for instance).

2595,1403930711,"The faithful dogs portrayed in this homecoming section of the story are symbolic. The swineherd's dogs, trained by Eumaeus to guard the hogs, charge Odysseus in the guise of an old beggar when he approaches the enclosure (B14, L33). The behaviour of Eumaeus on this occasion distinguishes him from those who gave Odysseus and his men a barbarous reception during their travels in strange lands. Also, his hurry to drive the dogs off and protect the 'old man' is different from the uncivilised behaviour one might expect of the suitors of Penelope were they to witness guard dogs rushing a stranger approaching Odysseus' courtyard. The swineherd's dogs recognise Telemachus, nuzzling him without a growl, as he returns from abroad (B16, L5-6); indoors, Odysseus is quick to perceive the meaning of the 'quiet welcome' (L6-12). Athena approaches the lodge, unseen by Telemachus but visible to Odysseus and the dogs (which respond by running off with a whimper) (B16, L84). Not every dog is man's best friend, though, as Book 14 ends with Eumaeus heading outside to sleep amidst the boars and taking with him a 'lance to fight off men and dogs' (L599). Another negative reference to dogs occurs when Eumaeus is called a dog by the goatherd Melanthius after he kicks at Odysseus in beggar form. Both the king and the swineherd refrain from responding with force, but Eumaeus can't keep himself from cursing Melanthius, who replies, 'All bark and no bite from the vicious mutt' (B17, 254-272). Finally, Argos sees through Odysseus' disguise, and the master's comment on the dog gives the swineherd a chance to praise the loyal animal and criticise the disloyal humans who have neglected both the dog and their duties to their absent master (B17, L317-360). The dogs guarding the swine and the dog guarding the palace know their place, are loyal to their masters and exhibit the kind of loyalty Odysseus must find in key servants and his son and wife if his homecoming is to be a success.",2

4312,1405984502,"I might be repeating myself here but, are we again the ones to be blamed?Ã‚Â So far I was enjoying Aeschylus, his Clytemnestra faced the argives at Ã‚Â their same level. She ruled the palace, controlled the guards and had this secret signal to be ready in case her husband appears. Brilliant politician, great orator. True she was unfaithful to her husband but Ã‚Â well Agamemnon was not practising celibacy at Troy., and if we follow R. Graves she might be the real heiress to the throne of Mycenae. True, she killed the warrior husband in the bath, not a very glorious death but, she purified him before the sacrifice (that should be among the pros in the trial imho).So I had my own Greek Lady Macbeth and it was fine.Then on the second play I felt Aschylus was not going to Ã‚Â make me happy. Then Orestes comes and:Before I lose hold of my senses, though,I openly declare to all my friends,not without justice did I kill my mother,stained as she was with murdering my father,Where is his brotherly love for Iphigenia? Ah well she was a girl, the fact that his father killed the wrong hare it is of no Ã‚Â importance.Ã‚Â And then the coup de grace and from Athena no Ã‚Â less:Ã‚Â ATHENA My office makes me last to judge this case.And I will cast my ballot for Orestes.No mother gave me birth, and in all thingsbut marriage I wholeheartedly approvethe maleÃ¢â‚¬â€I am entirely my fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s child.And this is why the killing of a womanwho killed her husband, guardian of the house,can have no overriding claim on me.860Orestes wins, even if the votes be equal.There you have it it is not a question of DikÃƒÂ© but a question of gender. So we have Ã‚Â our binary pairsold - newearth - heavencountry - cityroyalty -democracyfemale - maleunfair- justiceAnd I thought Hesiod was hard on us, Apollo is not only the god of poetry but of misoginy:.APOLLO IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you something else, to show how rightI am: the so-called mother of the childisnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s begetter, but only a sort770of nursing soil for the new-sown seed.The man, the one on top, is the true parent,while she, a stranger, fosters a strangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sprout,if no god blights it. And I can prove it to you:a father can give birth without a mother.The last sentence Ã‚Â no Ã‚Â doubt will have made laugh the audience but clever Aeschylus gives the final coup and wins the eternal thanks of the goddess when he continues:Ã‚Â And here before us is our witness, childof Olympian Zeus, daughter who never fedand grew within the darkness of a womb,a seedling that no goddess could bring forth.In all things, Pallas, and with all my power,Now I know why Athens was the chosen city. I have to admit it is a clever trick and maybe apart Ã‚Â from structuralism we have some functionalism at work, because how many goddesses can claim to be revered in such a powerful city and not having a mother? Not many.So all these pairs, these contrapositions between the Furies Ã‚Â and Apollo worked hand in hand into the way to Athens and Democracy. And it makes sense because this new system that has citizens instead of subjects, where men use discourse as an essential part of civic life, where women are not citizens really cannot have these old chthonic goddesses going around being more important Ã‚Â than Apollo who fought the snake or Athena the goddess who did not need a womb to be born.It is pure craftmanship, the perfect combination between structuralism and binary parts and functionalism and I personally admire more Aeschylus than ever. Ã‚Â Not Ã‚Â to mention the elegance in his expressions even when I did not read the original in Greek the scene of the trial is marvellous, like a ""You can't handle the truth!"" but in Athens. And Apollo saying:Ã‚Â APOLLO Our quiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s empty, all our arrows shot.Ã‚Â Just perfect.I mentioned Graves before, though he was not an official scholar because when he talks about Clytemnestra he mentions the matriarcal regime of Mycenae where she was the rightful heiress. I would love to see the whole thing under that ligh but matriarcal regime Ã‚Â in terms of politics has always been a little weak for me. What I feel here , following Aeschylus' plays is that in this new system the blood connection was not really important or essential to get power. The legitime heir born from the king and the queen was not loger necessary. Now they vote, they had theÃ‚Â Ã¡Â¼ÂÃŽÂºÃŽÂºÃŽÂ»ÃŽÂ·ÃÆ’ÃŽÂ¯ÃŽÂ± to rule, strategoi to command the armies. The legitime heir was not a real necessity so probably the vessel was not really what mattered anymore. My hope is that those vessels were at Ã‚Â least the affliction to Ã‚Â the citizens of Athens for a while.( I am using the Burian &amp; Shapiro translation, Oxford Univeristy Press. 2011)",2

422,1426282612,"Belief in the ""hot hand"" should itself have causal effects, which we'd expect to favor the player who has the ""hot hand""; it's really surprising that the net effect, at least to the degree of accuracy measured, was statistically insignificant. Does confidence actually improve a player's performance? Or is any increase in confidence during the ""hot hand"" balanced out by decrease in confidence while not having the ""hot hand""? Do the other players or coaches believe they notice the ""hot hand"" during the game and change their behavior---passing to the player more frequently, or defending against him more aggressively?Glancing over the article linked to by [REDACTED], several studies seem to indicate that increased confidence from making previous shots does affect performance... negatively. It's overconfidence, and so players try to make harder shots, which they naturally make less frequently: ""A 2009 study by John Huizinga and Sandy Weil suggests that it might be a good idea for players to disbelieve in the hot hand, even if it really exists! In a much larger data set than GVT's, they found a similar effect; after making a basket, players were less likely to succeed on their next shot. But Huizinga and Weil had records not only of shot success, but shot location. AndÂ thatÂ data showed a striking potential explanation; players who had just made a shot were more likely to take a more difficult shot on their next attempt. Yigal Attali, in 2013, foundÂ even more intriguing resultsÂ along these lines. A player who made a layup was no more likely to shoot from distance than a player who just missed a layup. Layups are easy and shouldn't give the player a strong sense of being hot. But a player is much more likely to try a long shot after a three-point basket than after a three-point miss. In other words, the hot hand might ""cancel itself out""â€”players, believing themselves to be hot, get overconfident and take shots they shouldn't.""If people were more rational, we could randomly select teams to either believe or not believe in the ""hot hand"" and see how performance changes; unfortunately most players' beliefs about such things are not so easily changed.",2

In this case, the difference is not small.Â To explain the difference, let's use a simple example, 4Â word misprints randomly distributed into a book of 2 pages, what is the probability that first page gets 2 misprints? Â This isÂ slightly different from the original question for the sake of explanation, one should easily extend this to the actual problem.Here is the solution using what I called classical method: Let's use 0 for misprint, and 1 for division of the pages, 01000 means the first page gets 1 misprint and 2nd page gets 3. The sample space becomes: {00001, 00010, 00100, 01000, 10000}, the event where first page gets 2 misprint is 00100.

1436,1430455063,"I was waiting to see if anyone else wanted to chime in, [REDACTED], but with the course having ended this might be asking for too much dedication. Â The analysis I am going to outline will require a little patience but each step is elementary.To begin we should realise that [REDACTED]'s analysis is based on expected values and subtleties can be lost in broad brush approximations. Â So now we should formulate the question a little more precisely.To begin consider a single family. Â Let $$X$$ denote the number of girls and $$w(n):=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X= n\} = 2^{-n-1}$$ for $$n\geq0$$ the associated mass function.Â  (This is the geometric distribution seen briefly in Lecture 6.1: d.) Â Under the conditions of the problem, the family has exactly one boy and so the probability that there is one boy and no girls (in other words, boys exceed girls) is given by Â \( \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{ X = 0 \} =Â w(0) = \frac12 \). Â The probability that there is precisely one boy and one girl (in other words, the genders are in balance) is given byÂ \(Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{ X = 1 \} =Â w(1) = \frac14 \).Â And the probability that there is more than one girl (girls exceed boys) is given byÂ \(Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{ X \geq 2 \} =Â \sum_{n=2}^\infty w(n) = 1 - w(0) - w(1) = 1 - \frac12 - \frac14 = \frac14 \). Â Thus, the probability that boys exceed girls is twice as large as the probability that girls exceed boys and the intuition based on expected values only seems to break down.What if we have many families, say $$n$$? Â Suppose that the number of girls in each of these families is represented by \( X_1 \), \( X_2 \), \( \dots \), \( X_n \). Â Then the total number of boys in the population is $$n$$ while the number of girls is chance-driven and given by \( S_n = X_1 + \dots + X_n \). Â The mass function of $$S_n$$ is given by the negative binomial distributionÂ \begin{equation*}Â  (\star) \qquad w_n(k) :=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = k\} = \binom{n+k-1}{n-1} 2^{-k-n} \qquad (k\geq0).\end{equation*}How do we prove this? Â The convolutional mechanism that we had used to derive the stability of the Poisson distribution in the Dangerous Bend Lecture 10.2: p is one way to show this but a direct combinatorial argument is available. Imagine that we arrange the children from the first family from left to right first in order of age with \( X_1 \) girls followed by the sole boy; then the children of the second family with \( X_2 \) girls followed by their boy; and so on. Â Viewed from left to right in our probability model, we have a string of Bernoulli trials where we have successive ""failures"" (girls) punctuated by ""successes"" (boys). Â (It is a sad commentary that our metaphorical language of Bernoulli successes and failures may actually be a fact of life in some parts of the world.) Â The sequence terminates with the \( n \)th ""success"" and so we can think of the number of girls in total in this metaphorical sense as the waiting time (or the number of failures) till the \( n \)th success. Â If you've had a chance to listen to Dangerous Bend Lecture 10.2: t you may be struck with a feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu. Â It is not an accident: the exponential density is the continuous counterpart of the geometric mass function. Â With this understanding in mind, we realise that the final trial must be a success (the \( n \)th boy). Â If the waiting time till the \( n \)th success (that is to say, the total number of girls) is \( k \) then there must be a total of \( k + n \) trials of which the last is a success. Â But then there must be exactly \( k \) failures distributed arbitrarily in the first \( k + n - 1 \) trials. Â As we are dealing with a fair coin, the probability of this is given by the binomial probability \( \binom{k + n - 1}k 2^{-(k + n - 1)} = \binom{k + n - 1}{n-1} 2^{-(k + n - 1)} \) [in view of the binomial coefficient identity seen in Lecture 2.2: b]. Â We multiply this by \( 2^{-1} \) to account for the fact that the final trial [the \( (k + n) \)th trial] is independent of the first \( k + n - 1 \) trials and must be a success and so we recover the mass function given in \( (\star) \) for the waiting time till the \( n \)th success (or, in our context, the total number of girls).With \( (\star) \) in hand, what is the probability that the number of girls is fewer than the number of boys? Â As there are exactly $$n$$ boys, leveraging additivity, this is given byÂ \begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_n(k) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}Â \binom{n+k-1}{n-1} 2^{-k-n}.\end{equation*}This looks formidable but if you attempt a numerical calculation, say, for $$1\leq n\leq 100$$, you will discover that the right-hand side always seems to be equal to $$\frac12$$. Â You will surely feel that this cannot be an accident (or, at least, that this merits further investigation) and so accordingly you may be led to conjecture that\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} = \frac12 \quad\text{or, equivalently,}\quadÂ Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} = \frac12\end{equation*}for all $$n\geq1$$. Â There are several ways we can go about proving this but having guessed the answer the simplest approach is by mathematical induction. Â The base case has already been established for the case of a single family, $$n=1$$, as $$S_1 = X_1$$ and we have seen thatÂ \begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_1\geq 1\} = Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_1\geq 1\}Â = 1 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_1 = 0\}Â  Â  = 1 - \frac12 = \frac12.\end{equation*}As induction hypothesis, suppose now that $$ \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1}\geq n-1\} = \frac12$$. Â Now, the inequality $$S_n\geq n$$ is satisfied when precisely one of the following two conditions holds: either $$S_{n-1}\geq n$$ or, for some $$0\leq k\leq n-1$$, Â $$S_{n-1} = k$$ and $$X_n\geq n-k$$. Â It follows that\begin{align*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} Â  Â  &amp;\overset{\text{(a)}}=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1}\geq n\} + Â \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k, X_n\geq n-k\}\\Â  Â  &amp;\overset{\text{(b)}}=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1}\geq n-1\} -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}Â  Â  Â  + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k\}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n-k\} \\Â  Â  &amp;\overset{\text{(c)}}= \frac12 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}Â \cdot \bigl(1 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n- (n-1)\}\bigr)Â  Â  Â Â + \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k\}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n-k\}.\end{align*}In this sequence, (a) follows by additivity; (b) by additivity to rewrite the first term on the right and by independence (as $$S_{n-1}$$ is independent of $$X_n$$) to factor the summands; and (c) by induction hypothesis and a little rearrangement of the terms of the sum to group the terms involving $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}$$. To show that $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} Â = \frac12$$ and so complete the induction it will hence suffice to show that\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}Â \cdot \bigl(1 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n- (n-1)\}\bigr)Â  Â  =Â Â \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k\}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n-k\}.\end{equation*}As $$X_n$$ is governed by the geometric distribution with mass function $$w(j) = 2^{-j-1}$$ for $$j\geq0$$, we see that, for any integer $$m\geq0$$, we have\begin{equation*}Â  \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq m\} = 2^{-m-1} + 2^{-m-2} + 2^{-m-3} + \dotsbÂ  Â  = 2^{-m-1}\bigl( 1 + 2^{-1} + 2^{-2} + \dotsb \bigr)Â  Â  = \frac{2^{-m-1}}{1 - 2^{-1}} = 2^{-m}.\end{equation*}And, as $$S_{n-1}$$ is governed by the negative binomial mass function \( w_{n-1}(k) = \binom{(n-1) + k -1}{(n-1) -1} 2^{-(n-1)-k} \) for $$k\geq0$$, the identity we are seeking to verify isÂ \begin{equation*}Â  \binom{(n-1) + (n-1) - 1}{(n-1) - 1} 2^{-(n - 1) - (n - 1)} \cdot \bigl(1 - 2^{-1}\bigr) Â  Â  = \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{(n-1) + k - 1}{(n - 1) - 1}Â 2^{-(n - 1) - k}\cdot 2^{-(n - k)},\end{equation*}or, what is the same thing,\begin{equation*}Â  \binom{2(n-2) + 1}{n-2} 2^{-2n + 2}\cdot 2^{-1}Â  Â  = 2^{-2n + 1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{(n - 2) + k}{n - 2}.\end{equation*}Simplifying both sides by cancellation of the common power of $$2$$, we hence wish to verify the identity\begin{multline*}Â  (\ast) \qquad \binom{2(n-2) + 1}{n-2} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{(n - 2) + k}{n - 2}Â  Â  Â  \overset{\text{(d)}}= \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\binom{n-2+k}k\\Â  Â  Â  = \binom{2(n-2)}{n-2} + \binom{2(n-2)-1}{n-2-1} + \binom{2(n-2)-2}{n-2-2} + \dots + \binom{2(n-2) - (n-2)}{(n-2) - (n-2)},\end{multline*}where the step marked (d) follows by Lecture 2.2: b as $$\binom{n-2+k}{n-2} = \binom{n-2+k}k$$. Â Simplify the algebra by writing $$m = n - 2$$. Â By repeated applications of Pascal's triangle [Lecture 2.2: c] we see that\begin{align*}Â  \binom{2m + 1}m Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m}{m-1} \\Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m-1}{m-1} + \binom{2m-1}{m-2}\\Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m-1}{m-1} + \binom{2m-2}{m-2} + \binom{2m-2}{m-3}\\[4pt]Â  Â  &amp;= \dotsb \\[4pt]Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m-1}{m-1} + \binom{2m-2}{m-2} + \dots + \binom{2m-m}{m-m}.\end{align*}Identifying $$m = n-2$$ in $$(\ast)$$, we verify the given identity and hence, tracing our path backwards, that $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} = \frac12$$, thus completing the induction.We conclude that $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} = \frac12$$ for all $$n$$ and hence that the probability that boys exceed girls in the population is one-half.What can be said about the probability that there are exactly as many girls and boys? The probability that girls and boys are balanced is given by\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\} = w_n(n) = \binom{2n-1}n 2^{-2n}.\end{equation*}We may get a feeling about how the right-hand side behaves for large $$n$$ via Stirling's formula [which asserts that $$N!\thicksim \sqrt{2\pi N}\, \bigl(\frac{N}e\bigr)^N$$ as $$N\to\infty$$]. A little elbow grease is all that is requisite to simplify the expression on the right and we obtain\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\} \thicksim \frac1{2\sqrt{\pi n}} \qquad (n\to\infty).\end{equation*}The probability of balanced genders decreases slowly with $$n$$.We may now draw the following conclusions from the analysis. Â As $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\}$$ is strictly positive for all $$n$$, we conclude that\begin{equation*}Â  \frac12 =Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n \leq n-1\} &gt;Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n+1\}\end{equation*}and so the chances that boys outnumber girls are strictly better than the chances that girls outnumber boys. Â On the other hand,\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n+1\}Â  Â  = \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\} \to 0 \qquad (n\to\infty)\end{equation*}(though the rate of decay on the right is slow â€” it only decays at the rate $$n^{-1/2}$$). Â This says that for large populations boys have a tiny edge over girls but the edge is very small.We can now ask other questions such as, for a given population size, is a discrepancy seen adequately explained by this sanitised and simple model? Â We have the tools now to begin exploring such questions.",2

1037,1428688550,"Yes! Your insertion ""of"" is really great. Now if you allow me to bury our horse, I think I have a way to get the flowers to bloom on his grave.I think the mental problem of our situation occurs because we lose sight of what A and B are because the set of Aâˆ©Ac and Bâˆ©Bc do not have explicit names we can use to fully describe the parts of the implied sample space as a whole. So to describe in words our full situation let us generically define sample space Toss1 as bold A = A + Ac because Aâˆ©Ac = 0 subset A along with subset Ac are partitioned by rows (diagram Toss1 above). Similarly, B = B + Bc except that the subsets of B are partitioned by columns. (diagram Toss2 above). So when we say to Aâˆ©B we are referring to it as a subset of Aâˆ©B and as long as neither A or B are empty, then Aâˆ©B &gt; 0. In matrix algebra terms we say that A and B form orthogonal (rows and column partition lines are 90 degrees to each other) relationships whose values are determined by multiplication. The aforementioned will be strictly true as long as Aâˆ©B/B = A which is just a tautology at this point until we bring in the concept of conditional proportions. But for our coin tossing experiments we know this to be true. So OK so far.Now let's really cement in our insights by the following ""gedanken"" experiment: Place two heads, our expected number of heads in four tosses, in a row. Now place the expected two tails in a row just below the heads. Put a piece of plexiglass (designating the ending of toss 1) over the coins and scribe a horizontal line in the plastic to separate the two rows. Now put two heads in a left column in such a way as to still see the coins from toss 1 below. Similarly, place the two tails expected from our toss 2 experiment in a right hand column. Place another piece of plexiglass over these coins and scribe a vertical line in the plastic. Now note what we have here, a physical representation of our two toss sample space. Now notice that as you look down through the top plastic plate you will ""see"" Aâˆ©B as a combination of A with B by crossing the pane of plastic separating A with B. You can still ""see""Â  A across the top row and B along the left column. Their intersecting conjunction across the planes is 90 degrees to the row and column lines. We can say that our total sample space consists of orthogonal subsetsÂ of A with B.Â  The Omega of A is 4, the Omega of B isÂ  4, but the Omega of Aâˆ©B is also 4 even though it takes 8 coins to create this sample space. Now toÂ ""see""Â  our new set Aâˆ©B in a single plane, take a photo looking down through the plexiglass ""flattening"" our layers together. This would now be akin to the subsets created when tossing both coins together. These subsets could be relabeled, say AiBj. They are disjoint and strictly additive in the new sample space AxB. We no longer have to keep them in row by column arrangement to correctly calculate their combined proportions. This is akin to enumerating all the possible AxB subsets in a one planar sample space.The purpose of the rules for set algebra is to allow us to make correct inference and calculations in terms of the implied orthogonality ofÂ  subsetsÂ  A and B. E.g. AâˆªB = A + B - Aâˆ©B = Acâˆ©B + Aâˆ©B + Aâˆ©Bc = 1 - Acâˆ©Bc Next up: what the heck does conditionality really mean? Are you still interested in the conversation?",2

Â The student who is willing to accept the fact that the continuum arises naturally from limiting sequences of discrete experiments can ignore this â€” the main point of the exercise was to make a case for the consideration of continuum experiments. Â For the others who would like a little more technical background, read on.You are quite right: there are numbers for which there are two dyadic representations. Â Generically, any number which can be expressed as a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator can be represented in two ways: a terminating expansion (with an infinite sequence of trailing 0s) and a nonterminating expansion (with an infinite sequence of trailing 1s). Â Here's another example:$$\frac38 = .011\dot{0} = .010\dot{1}.$$But this observation is not problematic because: Â the set of real numbers with two different dyadic expansions has length zero. Â Â What you've just done is identify your first non-trivial set of probability zero! Â We may hence pick by convention either of the representations in the cases where there are two, for example, we may by convention always agree to pick the non-terminating expansion, and none of the calculations are affected as the sets are equivalent up to a set of zero length. Â Formally, with this convention under our belt, every real number $$0 &lt; x \leq 1$$ in the unit interval will have a unique non-terminating expansion which corresponds to a unique sequence of coin toss outcomes. Â This leaves out certain sequences of coin tosses from the specification (those with an infinite sequence of trailing tails). Â This entire set of sequences may be put in one-to-one correspondence with the equivalent sequences corresponding to the non-terminating expansions. Â And the latter set may be identified with a countably infinite collection of real numbers. Â Now any countable set has length (formally, Lebesgue measure) zero. Â (This has to be shown. Â But this takes us into a detour into Lebesgue's theory of measure and I will not do that here.) Â This means that the set of coin toss sequences that we have ignored collectively has zero probability. Â Adding sets of zero probability to events does not change the probability and so none of the calculations is affected.The bottom line is this: the coin tossing experiment is equivalent to the unit interval up to a set of sample points whose probability is zero.I would cheerfully have avoided this technical digression (as I did in the lecture!) but once you picked up on the technical nuance you've forced my hand!",2
527,1426574658,"Re: Homework 1 Problem 2:
I am not following why â€œThe coin lands on tails and die B shows up whiteâ€ and â€œDie B shows up redâ€ are not both valid complete characterizations of Â sample points for the described chance experiment.
For this experiment, our sample space $$\Omega$$ consists of four sample points:
1.Â  Die A shows up red, 	(with probability 3/16)
	2.Â  Die A shows up white, 	(with probability 5/16)
	3.Â  Die B shows up red, 	(with probability 5/16)
	4.Â  Die B shows up white, 	(with probability 3/16)
Whether the coin showed a head or a tail is implicit in the outcome:Â  if die A shows up, it was a head, if die B, a tail. Â The result of the coin toss seems to be merely a detail accounting for why the outcome is biased. Â We couldÂ  call outcome 4 â€œThe coin lands on tails, and die B shows up whiteâ€, but this describes the same outcome.Â  Â  As Professor [Redacted] notes in lecture 6.1b â€œIt makes little matter what we call an outcome,â€¦ a rose by any other name would smell as sweet â€¦â€
So why is â€œDie B shows up redâ€ not consideredÂ  a complete characterization of an outcome for this experiment? [Redacted]",5

344,1426000614,"Your question is relevant and certainly deserves a thoughtful answer but the level of detail in your post was excessive: bear in mind that others have to think through it as well. Â I've kept the relevant segment of your post. Â You are quite right in that from a purely formal mathematical point of view it may well be true that a variety of different models can fit a given experiment. Â Nonetheless not all models are equal. Â In many cases there is a ""natural"" model for the problem. Â Usually, though not always, it is the simplest model that fits the circumstances. Â The philosophical principle called Ockham's razor dictates, abeyant any further information which leads us to reconsider, that we select the natural model and discard the others. Â Let me illustrate with a couple of examples.You are given data in the form of the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... and asked to infer a model. Â If you respondÂ $$2^n$$ then you've selected the natural model and, abeyant any further information, the exponential solution will be viewed as the ""correct"" model. Â But there are an infinity of models that can fit the given data: for example, the cubic polynomialÂ $$p(n) =1+\frac{5n}6+\frac{n^3}6$$ also fits the given data. But there are few circumstances in which the latter ""solution"" would be considered the right one. Tradition conditioned by experience leads us to the ""right"" model.Likewise, in chance, if we are given a problem involving the throw of a die, absent any further information we make the natural assumption that the die is fair (and, further, that it has six sides though we may relax this assumption if the context suggests a generalisation may be profitable). Â We can certainly posit zero probability events and they are important in the context of continuous experiments. Â (In the theory of measure this leads to a consideration of sets of measure zero and properties valid ""almost everywhere"".) Â But it is rare that zero probability events play a role in discrete settings. Â In such cases the natural models almost never involve sets of zero probability. Â The rare exceptions to this general rule almost always devolve around the desire for notational elegance and compactness: see, for instance, our notational conventions for mass functions on the integers. Â But, even in these cases, the expressions quickly devolve into a consideration of non-zero probabilities.It is in this sense that there is a ""natural"" chance model for this question. Â (The range of potential solutions given provide additional ammunition to direct one's thoughts towards the natural model.) Â The mathematician T. W. KÃ¶rner has written that ""battalions of facts, like battalions of men, are not always as strong as supposed"". Â And as in life, there are good choices and bad choices in mathematics: good choices elucidate and clarify; bad choices obfuscate and muddy the waters.It may seem that there is room for this kind of philosophical orientation and choice mainly in the applied sciences and mathematics but these considerations can also come to bear in choices and directions in pure mathematics.

Here you go, [REDACTED].  The combinatorial character of the problem is seen most clearly by application of Lord Kelvin's method of images (pioneered originally by D. André).  You can set up a simple recurrence by arguing about what the penultimate step should be.

Here is an example of the kind of result that is attainable.  Consider a slightly simpler setting where the gambler starts with wealth \(k\) and plays indefinitely until his wealth runs out. The probability that, starting with an initial wealth of \(k\), the gambler is bankrupted at the \(n\)th step is given by
\[
  \frac{k}n \binom{n}{\frac{n+k}2} 2^{-n}.
\]
(Of course, \(n\) and \(k\) must both be even or both odd: the gambler can be bankrupted on step \(n\) only if \(n+k\) is even.)  This is the famous ballot theorem of W. A. Whitworth.  Verify:
 If \(k = n\) we obtain \(2^{-n}\), as we should, as the gambler must lose at each of \(n\) trials in succession to lose on the \(n\)th step.
 If \(k=0\) then the probability is zero.  The gambler starts out bankrupt and will not be allowed to play.
 If \(k=1\) it is already non-trivial.  The probability of bankruptcy on the \(n\)th trial, given a starting wealth of \(k=1\), evaluates to
\[
  \frac1n\binom{n}{\frac{n+1}2} 2^{-n}.
\]
(Of course, \(n\) has to be odd.)  The expression does not simplify further but is estimated well by Stirling's formula when \(n\) is large by
\[
  \frac1n\binom{n}{\frac{n+1}2} 2^{-n} \thicksim \sqrt{\frac2\pi}\cdot n^{-3/2} \qquad (n\to\infty).
\]
The asymptotic equivalence sign \(\sim\) means that the ratio of the two terms tends to one as \(n\to\infty\).  So, if the gambler starts out with unit wealth his probability of lasting until the \(n\)th step before being bankrupted decays quite fast with \(n\): the probability decays as \(n^{-3/2}\).
 
You can fold in a termination condition where the gambler leaves with his winnings if his wealth reaches a given value \(N\) into the framework as well.

If you can get hold of a copy of my text in the local library you will find the analysis for simple random walk in pages 44 46 and 244 247; biased versions and return to the origin questions are in pages 546 560.  Feller's books also contain this material though it's spread across volumes 1 and 2.

579,1448646928,"
It's a nice question,[REDACTED].  What Boole gives us at the expense of a weaker bound is freedom from constraints.  And it is already remarkable that something can be said in such generality.  Adding constraints on the colouring should in principle yield tighter results.  But it's not going to be easy.

The simplest example of the kind of simply connected scenario you have in mind is in the unit circle \(\mathbb{S}^1\) where we can directly see the necessary and sufficient condition on a monochromatic arc length to include the vertices of a square.  A similar argument improves the 50% lower bound on \(\mathbb{S}^2\) and should be tight.  If we break simple connectivity then things get ugly very fast and I don't know of any general results which are tight (but a Google search may be worth trying).  I could imagining using something like the Lovsz local lemma or, perhaps better even, Janson's inequalities to improve on Boole's bound but this will entail at minimum second moment calculations.  And without sufficient structure these will be unpleasant.  \(\mathbb{S}^1\) should provide a sanity check for an approach.

I've been watching this unfold with some interest.  As [REDACTED] astutely pointed out in his opening broadside, there can be, and is, a pedagogical incentive occasionally for me to heighten a sense of paradox.  Undoubtedly, a pleasant sense of being surprised increases engagement and a desire to learn what may otherwise be perceived as a dry and forbidding subject.  I will use such artifices rarely but with the objective of engagement always in mind.  If overdone, however, it risks confusing the student and may actually deter engagement with the subject.  Aside from such occasional and rare motivational ploys, as a general rule I abhor sophistic arguments and attempt, insofar as I am able, to present the subject to the student in the same clear and pellucid light as I see it, shorn of mysticism and imbued with a sense of wonder at the power and subtlety of simple ideas.  You will have to form your own judgements as to whether I have got the balance right.  

Let me weigh in with two comments on the subject that has been so vigourously debated here.

Language can be tricky and even native speakers may walk away with subtly differing views of what was expressed depending upon their backgrounds, experience, and the linguistic traditions to which they have been exposed.  I cannot claim to be a native speaker of the language but I have taught at [REDACTED] for nigh on 30 years.  And after all this time I still occasionally bemuse, or even outright confuse, my colleagues with a turn of phrase or usage.  My poor students.  For what it is worth, my own interpretation of the disputed phrase is the one that [REDACTED] espouses.  But, as is evident from the impassioned discussion, folks of good faith may come to different interpretations.  So, are we at an impasse?  Not so, I think.

Problems of any heft, especially where there is a real-life application in view, are inevitably couched in language, frequently less than precise, and sadly incomplete in its specification.  But the fact that we do not start with a mathematically precise statement does not absolve us of the responsibility of attempting to model it in a precise, ideally mathematical, formulation.  In developing the model we keep in mind two principles: 1) strip away obfuscating and irrelevant detail; and, 2) take into account all the essential features.  The first is so that we end up with a problem of manageable complexity; the second so that we actually end up saying something useful for the problem at hand.  In practice, these aphorisms are easier to espouse than to put into practice.  In a birthday problem I may make the facile (and factually incorrect) assumption that every year has 365 days and birthdays are uniformly distributed across the year: this strips away pettifogging detail which is not ultimately critical.  But it would be a mistake to assume sampling of birthdays is without replacement as that removes an essential feature of the problem at hand.  And in the question that has sparked this post, my own inclination, naturally, would be to take things at face value with the idea that, for a first cut at least at the problem, how the data were arrived at may be of secondary interest, at least initially, while we set things up and see how they go.  But this is a matter of judgement and good folks may well disagree.  Ultimately, any attempt at modelling must be subject to the dispassionate assessment of the reader.

So, can we eliminate the ambiguity and begin, as [REDACTED]suggests, with a precise mathematical statement right from the start?  There are two objections to this.  The first, as pointed out above, is that most real problems are couched in language and have ambiguity baked into the cake.  While we will of course examine precisely stated toy problems with a view to making a concept crystal clear, for most students the motivation for examining a dry mathematical subject comes from real-world experiences and applications and we may as well learn as we go along that ambiguity is a feature of problems and make our best fist of modelling them.  The second objection is simply that, in my experience, an overly precise attempt at stating a problem not only gives it a patina of artificiality, but, a dry as dust description puts my students to sleep.  So we're back to engagement.  But this is again subjective and a matter of personal preference.  For me, I love mathematical precision, and I simultaneously love language with all its colour and ambiguity.  And I do my best to balance my two loves.

I should say that it delights me to watch students of a subject involved in impassioned discussions for that augurs a level of engagement that is wonderful.  For my part I view myself as a tour guide exposing my students to a beautiful mathematical city.  If I am a good tour guide I may be able to create a story that is fascinating, perhaps even memorable, and imprint the essential mathematical monuments and figures indelibly on the mind.  But this can only be the bare bones of the city in the time available for the guided tour: a short visit to Paris and a view of the Avenue des Champs-?lys?es, the Louvre, Notre Dame, and the Place de la Bastille with, perhaps, a side helping of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror.  To get a true appreciation of the rhythms, contours, and unexpectedly rich and unique aspects of the city, a student will have to immerse herself in it and persist with the exploration well after the guided tour has ended: the small museums, the treasures that can be found in the small bookstores along the Seine, the alleyways in Montmartre, the devotees of Paris St. Germain's brand of football, the storied Roland??arros, and, above all, the cafes.  A really good tour guide could hope to inspire such devotion.  As teachers we all aspire to this though, of course, most of us sadly fall short.

I have enjoyed your discussion and I have no wish to throttle or impede it.  But let me suggest two more problems to add fuel to the fire.

1) In the familial problem suppose that we start by saying that in the performance of a decennial census a household known to have two children is visited by a government employee.  A knock at the door is answered by a boy.  What is the chance that the other child is a boy?  [I could make an argument for any answer between 1/3 and 1 but I'll let you see what you make of it.]

2) A man puts a certain sum of money into one trouser pocket and double that sum into the other trouser pocket.  You don't know what the sums are or how they are distributed ahead of time but you do know that one sum is twice the other.  He then pulls out the money from his left pocket and shows you that he has $x in that pocket.  He offers to give you the money or, if you wish instead, to give you whatever sum is in his other pocket.  What is your best strategy?  [One simple argument might be that the other pocket contains either $2x or $x/2 with equal probability.  So, if you elect blindly to take the money in the other pocket without knowing in advance what it contains then you will make, on average, $$\frac12\cdot \frac{x}2 + \frac12\cdot 2x = \frac{5x}4$$ which of course exceeds $$x$$.  Paradox?]

I will end this post here as I see that I have to go to class now and will end up, no doubt, confusing my doctoral students.  On tap today is a story of history and empire, the peregrinations of a mosquito, a Nobel on explorations of black holes, why two violins are twice as loud as one violin, and what connects all these in the development of the mathematical theory of random walks.  So we should have fun, confusion or no.

638,1449391670,"Dear Dr. [REDACTED],In September 2014, as a first-year undergraduate, I enrolled in an online MOOC called ""Probability"". At that time, I really had no idea what probability meant, except for the bits that I've learnt in Professor [REDACTED]. I glanced over the first two weeks of material already posted - that was such an incredible long list. Fear of not being able to finish all the material, I quitted this class, hoping to make an eventual return.After that, I started my first year in university, taking honors math as a challenge. Later I also started to study fundamentals of computer algorithms and data structures on my own through MOOCs. I started to get into contact with probability - pdfs, expectations, variance, independence, etc. Some of these concepts, such as expectations, probability as an integral are pretty straight forward, but some are rather more complicated, as I really don't have a good understanding of independence when receiving a crash course on the subject for a proof of an algorithm's efficiency. In any case, I found myself in the need to learn subject in a more ""systematic"" approach, and promised myself to take a MOOC on it.I was excited to find out that this MOOC was back in the fall of 2015. I promptly enrolled and even verified my course work. Indeed, a large of material was covered each week, and sometimes I found it difficult to grasp all content in a short period of time. However, eventually I got used to the pace of the course. I kept on looking forward to each week's material to arrive, simply because of how much it resembled a great novel to me. All concepts are explained in thorough depth, derived and proved step-by-step and illustrated using fascinating examples, and new materials are connected to past content very well. The homework problems really get one to think about the concepts and go over the mathematical derivations - there is nothing more that a amatuer fan of mathematics can demand for, except perhaps for the course to span for a longer period, so that one can have a chance to explore all the material thoroughly.As this course was coming to an end, I realized that I have gained more than the foundations in probability from this course. I am even more intrigued by the beauty of mathematics, and keen on continuing my studies in more advanced probability/mathematics. Furthermore, I also started to tackle new problems and ideas at a slower pace to absorb the content better. The course has provided me with many invaluable insights, much beyond what is stated in the course syllabus.I have always thought that having an outstanding mathematical professor is perhaps one of the best gift one can receive on his way to explore the world. I am truly grateful that you have decided to offer this course to students around the world. It is truly my honor to learn this material from you.?Thank you very much.Sincerely,[REDACTED]",2

Bear in mind,[REDACTED], that every mass function has to be non-negative [the positivity axiom] and that the atomic probabilities (the masses) have to add to $$1$$ [the normalisation axiom].  This implies, among other things, that no individual mass function can be everywhere above another mass function.  If that were possible than the sum of probabilities for the dominating function would have to be larger than the sum of probabilities for the dominated mass function and so at least one of the two would have to violate the normalisation axiom.  In general, hence, two different mass functions are not directly comparable: they will each spread unit mass around in different ways and each of them will have to be bigger than the other somewhere.

What does this observation say about binomial probabilities?  Recall that the binomial distribution has a unimodal character, first increasing to a maximum at a point or two adjacent points, then decreasing.  The distribution peaks near its expected value. Thus, the function $$b_{100}(k; 0.3)$$ peaks at the value $$k = 30$$, the function $$b_{100}(k; 0.5)$$ peaks at the value $$k = 50$$, and the function $$b_{100}(k; 0.8)$$ peaks at the value $$k = 80$$.  The following table lists the truncated values of each of these mass functions at each of these points.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l|lll}
b_{100}(k; p) &amp; k = 30 &amp; k = 50 &amp; k = 80\\\hline
p = 0.3 &amp; 0.0868 &amp; 2.3\times 10^{-5} &amp; 4.3\times 10^{-27}\\\hline
p = 0.5 &amp; 1.3\times 10^{-5} &amp; 0.0796 &amp; 1.6\times 10^{-11}\\\hline
p = 0.8 &amp; 6.3\times 10^{-25} &amp; 4.2\times 10^{-10} &amp; 0.0993
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Because of the rapid decay of the binomial distribution away from its centre, each column contains one moderately large probability near 10% (for the distribution achieving its maximum value there) but the corresponding probabilities at this location for the other two distributions are tiny as the location is far from their centres.  The three figures in Tableau 10.1: c make this very evident graphically.  If $$n$$ is smaller the storyline remains the same but the probabilities will not have decayed so dramatically fast as you discovered in your numerical investigation.

Intuition can be tricky when learning a new subject.  And this seems to be particularly the case for the mathematical science of probability.  But this is not at all unusual.  As we explore further, we get better at seeing problems in the right perspective and our refined intuition ripens with experience.

Yes, indeed, [REDACTED].  Your observation is perceptive.  In practice, especially when sample sizes are relatively small and the underlying distribution is discrete, the normal approximation picks up a ""discretisation"" error at the end points of integration.  A statistician will occasionally attempt to improve matters slightly by employing what is called a continuity correction which attempts to cancel opposing errors on either side of an end point in the integral.

In practice, however, we should employ such approximations with caution.  The other sources of uncertainty and error in the modelling (independence, bias, and so on) may well be more significant.  An apt slogan: When \(n\) is small, proceed with care.  A rule of thumb (which itself should be viewed with caution) is that \(npq\) should be at least \(10\); for a fair coin this translates into \(n\) about \(40\).

To make assurance doubly sure we will want to provide an error estimate as well, and error estimates are indeed available via the Berry??ss?en inequalities, for instance.  But the theory behind them gets much more arduous.

First of all, I have never said that you have to treat your patients or I treat my patients exclusively with homotoxicologic medicine... Why? Because I don&#39;t think like that!
Homotoxicology is a complementary therapy. I don&#39;t use it alone.
For example Traumeel, this is the medication that has deeper studies, Traumeel is an inflammation  regulatory medication, it makes the effect and NSAID, this medication is used by sport teams like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, etc.

equivalence is a logical fallacy where there appears to be a logical 
equivalence between two opposing arguments, but when in fact there is 
none. Journalists use a form of this logical fallacy when comparing two 
sides of a scientific debate in an attempt to provide a balance between a
 scientific and denialist point of view. However, there is no 
equivalence between the two sides, when one is supported by evidence, 
and the other side with little or no evidence, of which most is of low 
quality. In other words, in false equivalence, someone will state that 
the opposing arguments have a passing similarity in support, when, on 
close examination, there is large difference between the quality of 
evidenceThere are often two sides, but oftentimes, the evidence points strongly in the direction of one.  In these cases, you should reject the side that is not supported by evidence - this has nothing to do with ""being closed minded"" or ""not considering the other side.""  One should approach scientific questions with an open mind, but one should also be ready to accept viewpoints which run counter to one's pre-established prejudices when scientific evidence challenges them.  Holding staunchly to our beliefs when evidence points the other direction is the epitome of having a closed mind, one which is static, unchangeable, and immune to the probings of reality.  ",4

2079,1382450611,"This is rather long and I'm no expert, so it probably has a few mistakes. Your question's interesting so I accidentally wrote an essay.There are lots of rules about experimenting on human subjects, for good reason. You have to make sure that you're not putting the participants at unjustifiable risk (if there's any risk you have to be able to explain your reason for thinking this study will benefit people enough to be worth it.) It's considered unethical to compare something to no treatment if there's a better alternative available- for example you should compare a new painkiller to ibuprofen or something rather than sugar pills- or to deny someone an effective treatment they would otherwise get. Now think about this in the context of a randomised controlled trial of vaccines. You're putting both the participants and anyone exposed to them at risk of vaccine-preventible disease. They are, essentially, being denied the standard of care. And you're either telling parents that their children won't get the vaccine or will get the vaccine because you flipped a coin- or else not just letting them know. Now, that's necessary in a randomized controlled trial, but a lot of people might not want to participate in this, and you'll need a large sample size to see if there are any problems with the vaccine. You could also do an observational study, and they have been done (not always well), but there are a few problems with this too. First of all you'll need a lot of participants, especially because the unvaccinated control population is often a lot smaller. Unless whatever you're looking for happens almost all the time you'll need a ton of participants for both- think of the rotovirus vaccine in the most recent lecture, with intussusception in 1 in 10,000 children. You'll also potentially find some differences which are purely by chance, especially if you have fewer people than you should. Then people who vaccinate and people who don't vaccinate may be different in other ways too. People who have expensive cars are probably going to live longer than those who don't, because people who can afford expensive cars are likely to be richer and therefore live longer. It doesn't mean awesome cars extend your lifespan.  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/1/187.fullIn order to do this trial, especially for the RCT, the evidence should say there's a chance that kids getting vaccines or a vaccine might not be better off. So you have to get that evidence first, for vaccines in general, because that's the standard that's been set by people who don't believe in any vaccination- that vaccines, in general, rather than one specific one, are harmful or more harmful than beneficial. Testing one specific vaccine is a whole 'nother kettle of fish and has been done, and is done.",3

I think Paul stated that it is estimated that over time it has killed 500 Million people which is not unreasonable I suppose.You only see it's rapid decline after the introduction of vaccination.   One of the major factors with Smallpox is that it needs human to human transmission,  it does not live in another host and it cannot lay dormant in the body or things like the soil. When you read about it's eradication you see how it was done,  the WHO used Ring vaccination in the end to stop outbreaks from spreading.   When someone was discovered with Smallpox then whole areas were vaccinated around the outbreak so that it could not spread.   This saved having to vaccinate every single person.The only debate that I can see is whether the last remaining samples of Smallpox in labs should be destroyed or not so that it cannot be used as a biological weapon.

She was diagnosed with encephalopathy following her well baby visit where she had received the MMR and Varicella vaccination (short version of her reaction).  This diagnosis of course remained until she was later (at 2 1/2) diagnosed on the autism spectrum.  I find the idea that the science is ""in"" and vaccines absolutely cannot cause autism ridiculous.  If we had never sought help for my daughter and recieved that second diagnosis of autism based on behaviors, then the medical community would still be saying my daughter had this damage from her vaccines.  It is plain and simple words games.  If you look up the definition of encephalopathy in the injuries awarded by our US government it is ""strangely"" the same things they use to diagnose someone with autism.   I find it funny that there is even a debate so many years later.  The scientific and medical communities cannot have it both ways.  You can't deny any possibility and in the same breath admit that in ""some people with underlying conditions it can"" or that if you call it what it is ""encephalopathy, seizures, etc"" and skip that autism label it is true.  Just nonsense.  We scream about why parents do not trust or why they do not just look at the ""evidence""...and yet that evidence sits right there in the manufacturers inserts and vaccine trials and we continue to deny it.  I am not saying ALL autism is a vaccine injury, or the MMR is the culprit in all autism;  but I am saying that lying about those cases that are, has served only to add fuel to the fire.  I now teach parents how to research the facts for themselves, so that they can make an informed decision.  I don't claim to know what is right for their family or guarantee anything but I can empower them to learn as much as possible and show them how to find the facts.  I think this is a great that there is such open discussion and even debate as that is how people learn and love that parents are speaking about their decisions!",2

They were slightly ill after some of the combined jabs... but it's a small price to pay so that they can't get polio and co. My sister in law had meningitis as a child and it has left it's mark with some learning difficulties, which while mild have affected her life. Also bear in mind, that by vaccinating my healthy children, I am helping to protect children too young or too seriously unwell to receive the shots, because I'm contributing to herd immunity. There has been a measles epidemic in Wales recently... and it caused a death... there have been cases in Germany where anti-vac people have taken their children to the doctors with measles and infected newborns, who later developed complications and died.

The two concurrent Phase II clinical trials, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, are designed to gather critical information about the safety of the candidate vaccine and the immune system responses it induces when administered at different dosages and with or without adjuvants, substances designed to boost the body immune response to vaccination.Human cases of H7N9 influenza first emerged in China in February 2013, with the majority of reported infections occurring in the spring. As of Aug. 12, 135 confirmed human cases, including 44 deaths, have been reported by the World Health Organization. Most of these cases involved people who came into contact with infected poultry. Although no H7N9 influenza cases have been reported outside of China and the virus has not demonstrated sustained person-to-person transmission, there is concern that it could mutate to pose a much greater public health threat.??7N9 avian influenza virus ??like all novel influenza virus strains to which people have not been exposed ??has the potential to cause widespread sickness and mortality,??said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ??e are now testing a vaccine candidate with and without adjuvant in an effort to prepare for and, hopefully, protect against this possibility.??/p>The two clinical trials, which will enroll healthy adults ages 19 to 64, will evaluate an investigational H7N9 vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur. The candidate vaccine was made from inactivated H7N9 virus isolated in Shanghai, China in 2013. Adjuvants are being tested with the investigational vaccine because previous vaccine research involving other H7 influenza viruses has suggested that two doses of vaccine without adjuvant may not produce an immune response adequate to provide effective protection. In pandemic situations, adjuvants also can be used as part of a dose-sparing strategy, which would allow production of more doses of vaccine from the available supply of the viral antigen, thereby allowing a greater number of people to be vaccinated more quickly.The first clinical trial, led by Mark J. Mulligan, M.D., of Emory University in Atlanta, will enroll as many as 700 study participants who will be randomly assigned to one of seven groups (up to 100 participants in each group). Each group will receive two equivalent dosages (3.75 micrograms [mcg], 7.5 mcg, 15 mcg or 45 mcg) of the candidate vaccine, approximately 21 days apart. Five of the groups will receive the vaccinations along with MF59 adjuvant, developed by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics.Of these five groups, three will receive adjuvant with both vaccinations; one group of participants will receive adjuvant only with the first vaccination; and another group of participants will receive adjuvant only with the second vaccination. Two groups of participants will not receive adjuvant. The MF59 adjuvant that is being tested is also contained in the Fluad seasonal influenza vaccine currently licensed in Europe and Canada for use in people age 65 years or older.The second trial, led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., M.P.H., of Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, will enroll as many as 1,000 participants. Each participant will be randomly assigned to one of 10 groups (up to 100 participants per group) and will receive two equivalent doses (same dosages as the other trial) of the investigational H7N9 vaccine given 21 days apart.Seven of these groups will receive the vaccinations either with or without AS03 adjuvant, developed by GlaxoSmithKline Biologics. Two groups will receive their first vaccination with AS03 or MF59 adjuvant and then receive the alternate adjuvant at time of second vaccination. One group will receive the MF59 adjuvant at both vaccinations. The AS03 adjuvant that is being tested was used in a 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, Pandemrix, used in several European countries during the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic.In both studies, which are expected to conclude in December 2014, a panel of independent experts will closely monitor safety data at regular intervals throughout the trial.The vaccine studies are being conducted at the eight NIAID-funded Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; Children?? Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati; Emory University, Atlanta; Group Health Cooperative, Seattle; Saint Louis University, St. Louis; University of Iowa, Iowa City; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore; and Vanderbilt University, Nashville. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston will conduct the trial as a subcontractor to Baylor College of Medicine.Further information about both clinical trials can be found at http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov using the identifiers:NCT01938742 and NCT01942265.For more information, visit NIAID?? Influenza Web portal.

1557,1380195714,"Vaccination and immunization are the same thing.  Vaccination/immunization results in and active immune response - this can only happen when the body (immune system) is in contact with an antigen that invokes an immune response, so either a vaccine, virus, bacteria, etc etc.  Passive immunity is what is obtained when mothers breast-feed their babies, for example, which passes antibodies to them.  This only infers immunity for a short period of time, and the baby is required to build up their own antibodies, which is only done by coming into contact with the antigen.  So, a mother could pass some short-term immunity to her baby by breast-feeding, which will keep the baby protected until it receives it's vaccination...or until it comes in contact with the disease, whichever comes first.",2

1254,1379346621,"The last I heard, D.O. were still not allowed
to be licensed as physicians in Canada.  

I spent most of my childhood in a small town in
[REDACTED] ]where we had three hospitals ?two for the MDs and one for the Dos.  We went to both.  The osteopathic hospital functioned basically
just like the other two, except that the DOs also knew how to perform
manipulations. Since I was just a kid at the time, I didnt really know what
the difference was between these two types of doctors.  When I was 8 my mother took a job as the
reception in the office of an MD who was also the county health officer who
could not hide distain for DOs, even referring to them as ??r.??  Now the town just has one hospital and I
think MDs and DOs work side by side.

When I was 15 I moved to [REDACTED] which
was just in the process of recognizing DOs. I recall one of my high school
teachers warning us that a new doctor in the area was a DO (i.e. not a real doctor.)  Based on my family experience,
that sounded odd to me.  About 13 years
later, I took a job as an EEG tech. in a hospital located in logging town near
the [REDACTED]   It had both MDs
and DOs, but I soon got the impression that the DOs were still the new kids on
the block, and not accepted by everyone, including my supervisor ??until she
finally got up the courage to let one of them use manipulations to treat her
aching neck.  She had a much more
positive attitude towards DOs after that. 
Another DO there was an orthopedic surgeon.  He removed two of my bunions and did a great
job.  Now in the U.S., DOs specialize in
every major field of medicine just like MDs. ( In fact, some would complain
that theye become to much like MDs, perhaps having overly embraced the
allopathic treatments and forgetting some other their more holistic osteopathic
roots. 

DOs may obtain a license by passing the Osteopathic
Medicine board exams but many also take all the levels of the USMLE (taken by
MDs) so that they may undergo residencies in large medical centers.  Now some of the osteopathic medical schools
are even attached to state universities in states as diverse as Texas, Oklahoma,
Florida, and Ohio.  Most such schools are
private.  Many of their grads set up
practice in areas where there is a shortage of physicians. Many patients prefer
DOs to MDs as their primary care physician because they tend to look at the
patient condition from a more holistic perspective, and often have a much
better bedside manner than MDs.  If I
were interested in training as a physician, I?? much rather become a DO than
and MD.

Mercola, by the way, is the only DO I
personally have ever heard of who markets health products.  Again, I included his article because of its
information about the revolving door relationship between US government health
agencies and big Pharma.  I think that
this problem and the freedom manufactures of alternative treatments have to
make unsubstantiated claims have the same root cause, namely the excessive
corporate power that is so prevalent in the U.S. Alternative medicine
manufacturers tend to be careful in complying with the FDA?? restriction that
they not claim that their products actually cure any diseases.  So, instead they just say, for example, that
their products support hair growth, or support the immune system.  Of course even claims such as these should be
substantiated.  The real tragedy here is
twofold.  First, thousands (or millions)
of people throw away their hard-earned money on products that aren?? going to
help them.  Secondly, by not routinely
testing alternative treatments, we fail to find out which ones actually work
and, according, which ones it?? actually worthwhile for patients to spend their
money and place their hopes.  The end
result is that extremists on both ends (allopathic and alternative
practitioners) may unfairly slander each other.  

I personally am encouraged to see more and more
integrative medicine clinics popping up at places like the Univ. of Bridgeport,
the Univ. of Arizona (under Andrew Weil, M.D.) and, I think also at U.C. San
Francisco School of Medicine.  However,
whatever wonderful treatments they uncover must be thoroughly tested by
qualified experts who do not stand to gain from their licensing by the FDA or
their subsequent marketing.  Otherwise,
the result would be far worse for consumers than what they have now, because at
least now, most understand that it?? a buyer-beware
jungle out there.  If unscrupulous
alternative treatment docs and marketers were able to financially influence or
speed-up the FDA approval process of their products and treatments, then the
public (at least initially) might not be aware that the buyer-beware jungle would not have gone away, but rather would only
have been cleverly cloaked in official approval. Yes, we??e been there and done
that before, haven?? we?",2

660,1378415475,"Hi, I am a Public Health Nurse working in [REDACTED](about to spend a year working in [REDACTED]).Professor [REDACTED]'s first lecture stated that if you are allergic to egg, this may be a reason to consider NOT getting the Influenza vaccine.  We always ask about egg allergy prior to giving Influenza vaccine to anyone because of this concern, as the vaccine is made inside eggs, and there is a potential for some residual egg protein to remain in the vaccine.This year Australia released a new Immunisation Handbook for vaccine providers, and in this book it states:A history of anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction to eggs has 
previously been considered an absolute contraindication to influenza 
vaccination. However, there have now been a number of studies indicating
 that the majority of persons with egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, 
can be safely vaccinated with influenza vaccines that contain less than 1
 g of ovalbumin per dose8-10(see 4.7 Influenza).
The majority of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis cases reported as 
likely due to egg allergy occurred following administration of one of 
the older formulations of influenza vaccine.9
 Today, due to manufacturing changes, the quantity of egg ovalbumin 
present in the majority of influenza vaccines used in Australia is less 
than 1 ?g of ovalbumin per dose.8
 Note that the amount of residual egg ovalbumin may vary from year to 
year due to manufacturing processes, vaccine batches and country of 
origin. The PI of the vaccine to be given should be checked for the 
vaccine?? ovalbumin content prior to vaccine administration.8,9,11,12 
Given that there is still a small risk of anaphylaxis, it is 
essential that persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction to 
eggs are vaccinated in facilities that have staff who are able to 
recognise and treat anaphylaxis.8,9
 Allergy testing (e.g. skin testing) with influenza vaccine prior to 
administration is not recommended, as there is poor correlation between 
test results and vaccine tolerance.8,9
 Detailed information on influenza vaccination of individuals with an 
allergy to eggs can be found in the Australasian Society of Clinical 
Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) guidelines8 (available at www.allergy.org.au/health-professionals/papers/influenza-vaccination-of-the-egg-allergic-individual).http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/handbook10-3-3",2

Epub 2011 Aug 23.Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism?Tomljenovic L, Shaw CA.SourceNeural Dynamics Research Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia, 828 W. 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 1L8. lucijat77@gmail.comAbstractAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) are serious multisystem developmental disorders and an urgent global public health concern. Dysfunctional immunity and impaired brain function are core deficits in ASD. Aluminum (Al), the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, is a demonstrated neurotoxin and a strong immune stimulator. Hence, adjuvant Al has the potential to induce neuroimmune disorders. When assessing adjuvant toxicity in children, two key points ought to be considered: (i) children should not be viewed as ""small adults"" as their unique physiology makes them much more vulnerable to toxic insults; and (ii) if exposure to Al from only few vaccines can lead to cognitive impairment and autoimmunity in adults, is it unreasonable to question whether the current pediatric schedules, often containing 18 Al adjuvanted vaccines, are safe for children? By applying Hill's criteria for establishing causality between exposure and outcome we investigated whether exposure to Al from vaccines could be contributing to the rise in ASD prevalence in the Western world. Our results show that: (i) children from countries with the highest ASD prevalence appear to have the highest exposure to Al from vaccines; (ii) the increase in exposure to Al adjuvants significantly correlates with the increase in ASD prevalence in the United States observed over the last two decades (Pearson r=0.92, p&lt;0.0001); and (iii) a significant correlation exists between the amounts of Al administered to preschool children and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries, particularly at 3-4 months of age (Pearson r=0.89-0.94, p=0.0018-0.0248). The application of the Hill's criteria to these data indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be causal. Because children represent a fraction of the population most at risk for complications following exposure to Al, a more rigorous evaluation of Al adjuvant safety seems warranted.",2

386,1378266618,"Rotavirus rates fell in adults, too, after vaccineTuesday, August 27, 2013Related MedlinePlus PagesChildhood ImmunizationRotavirus InfectionsBy Genevra PittmanNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Fewer older children and adults were hospitalized for severe diarrhea once the U.S. started vaccinating babies against rotavirus in 2006, according to a new study.Rotavirus is one cause of the ""stomach flu,"" or gastroenteritis, and introduction of the rotavirus vaccine has already been tied to a drop in related hospitalizations among preschoolers. But whether vaccinating babies would also confer protection for older people was unclear, researchers said.""This study confirms the benefits of the rotavirus vaccine program, but it also shows there's an unexpected benefit to the population at large,"" Ben Lopman, who worked on the study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.""This is one example of what we call herd immunity,"" he told Reuters Health.""By vaccinating young children you prevent them from getting sick, but you also prevent them from transmitting (rotavirus) to their siblings and their parents.""The initial rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the U.S. in 1998 and pulled the following year due to concerns it might cause blocked bowels in babies.Newer versions, which are given orally, became routine in 2007. Pre- and post-release testing of those vaccines has not shown those same side effects (see Reuters Health story of January 5, 2012 here: http://reut.rs/AAe8bT).For their study, the CDC researchers compared data on a nationally-representative sample of hospital stays by children and adults diagnosed with rotavirus or unspecified gastroenteritis in 2000-2006 and 2008-2010.Rotavirus testing is rarely performed in adults, they noted, so many more unspecified gastroenteritis cases were included.As previous studies have shown, rotavirus rates among young children dropped after the start of vaccination; there were 80 percent fewer discharges for rotavirus among kids under five in the post-vaccine study years than in pre-vaccine years.Rotavirus-related discharges also dropped by 70 percent for children aged five to 14, by 53 percent for 15- to 24-year-olds and by 43 percent among adults aged 25 to 44.Likewise, discharges for cause-unspecified gastroenteritis fell by 30 percent among five- to 14-year-olds after 2007, by 11 percent among teenagers and young adults and by six percent for adults under 45.Although it's not clear how many of those unspecified cases were caused by rotavirus, reductions were primarily seen in March and April - the peak months for rotavirus hospitalizations before the vaccine, the researchers wrote Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.""The pattern that we've seen after the introduction of vaccines is very consistent,"" Lopman said.He said prior estimates showed between 55,000 and 70,000 young children were hospitalized for rotavirus every year before 2006.""The benefits of the vaccine have been demonstrated time and again,"" he said.""Increasing vaccine coverage could bring even more benefit from what has occurred to date.""SOURCE: http://bit.ly/MvXYT6 Journal of the American Medical Association, online August 27, 2013.",2

She is up to date on her vaccinations, but she recently tested positive for an egg allergy (as well as milk, tree nuts, and sesame), so I am nervous about the vaccines that involve egg protein (MMR, flu, chicken pox).

In the US, often when vaccines are not recommended, they are not covered by insurance, they are not discussed by providers and pubic health agencies do not have resources to educate about them. So, as we do the math and conclude that shingles vaccine might not be a good public health investment using public dollars, what would be the solution for getting people to know about the vaccine and its availability? 1) We have heard that some people can't afford it, 2) we know that shingles pain can be so severe that people consider suicide, and 3) we will set the stage for a two-tiered system whereby people that can afford it, get it and those who can't afford it, can't.The same may be true of the new meningococcal type B vaccine where the CDC's advisory committee only recommended the vaccine for high risk groups because of the cost-benefit analysis. They will revisit the general recommendation question in June.Then, there is the HPV-9 vaccine not given preference over the HPV-2 and -4 versions even though it can protect more people from cancer.It used to be that the CDC's recommendations were based on what is best for the public's health and state laws were often where the cost/resources questions were determined. More recently cost-benefit analyses became part of the ACIP charter. So, where does that leave us for making sure that we don't have to tell parents their child could have been saved from a meningococcal type B vaccine that is available? their grandparent could still be self-sufficient if he/she had the shingles vaccine to prevent their current case of shingles? and their spouse would still be here to help raise their children if he/she had had the 9-valent HPV vaccine instead of the one the office happened to have in stock?We recently published an article about this in our newsletter for healthcare providers; part 2 will be published in May:http://vec.chop.edu/professionals/vaccine-healthcare-providers/news-views/#acip-changesI look forward to hearing some ideas/potential solutions.

If you look at the small pox statistics in both Britain and the U.S both prior to and after the implementation of the small pox vaccine you'll see that rates of infection were higher in vaccinated areas and one was more likely to die from small pox if they contracted it and had been vaccinated. Why do you think the ""anti-vaccine"" movement started after the small pox vaccine was implemented? It killed and severely disabled people. *You should also consider how the diagnostic criteria changed after the implementation of the small pox vaccine.C. The diagnostic criteria for polio changed after the licensure of the polio vaccine to make it look more effective. What is now aseptic meningitis was non-paralytic polio. Coxsackie, DDT, arsenic, and lead poisoning, GBS, enteroviruses, and any other disease that could yield paralysis for 24 hours or more was automatically given the diagnosis of polio prior to the vaccine. For almost 30 years the only cases of paralytic polio in this country were caused by OPV and it is still paralyzing people all over the world.

This is something that is taken into consideration during vaccine development, leading to the evolution of vaccines (new vaccine strains..). Unfortunately for chicken and farmers, the development of Marek vaccine seems to be on hold, while more pathogenic strains appear (mainly because some efficacy remains, but mostly because herpesvirus are not so simple to work on). This is not a reason to doubt vaccine, this is a reason to ask collectively companies to push on research of a new vaccine. It should be said also that in ovo/day 1 vaccination has been promoted for economical reason, but may not be the best way to acquire strong immunity (leading to insufficient immunity, inapparent infection..).

Still, I followed the recommendation at the time of cocooning my baby by making sure those closest to her had their boosters, and looked forward to news of a better vaccine.

My children, as well as we, their parents have been vaccinated, according to the official schedule in our respective countries. What happens is we want to be informed and we like to think that critical thinking is better than just accumulating information, although it cannot happen without the latter.In this course we hear a lot about numerous studies that have been performed by the pharmaceuticals in order to prove the medical safety of the vaccines, some of them being cited in the bottom of the slide, something I celebrate (there is nothing vaguer than ""a lot of important scientists""). Yesterday I did a random search for both ethylmercury and methylmercury, wanting to get better acquainted with both (I am an architect, not anything related to the health sphere or chemical/biological sciences). I accidentally ran into a site that took me to this reccord of the Congress here. For those too busy to read it all, an important study cited a lot to dissociate any relationship between mercury levels and autism, was proven to be wrong (a statistical mistake, leading to a false interpretation of the numbers, initially reported to be statistically insignificant). My first thought was to oversee it, but then I read the authors (Ip et al.) admitted the mistake and rectified. That made me perform a search for the authors of the reanalysis and they seem to me pretty sound scientists with a solid background. You can find Dr. Catherine Desoto here, a link to her article together with Dr. Hitlan here and, a detailed FAC to the attacks the article received here. The last one is important if people want to get sense of what the article actually concluded and how misinformation is easily spread out.The article has nothing to do with vaccines, but the study it proved wrong was widely used to assure, hence mercury levels have nothing to do with autism, so vaccines dont either.My point is, if this so widely cited study was wrong, how many others out their could be? How would the actual state of knowledge change if all of them were re-examined in detail? I think, usually scientists are busy doing their own research, rather than recalculating the statistical values of fellow-scientists and only something quite incoherent would make them actually do so.

1260,1431001924,"Hello [REDACTED] --Let's see if we can turn this discussion into one about vaccines. There is, perhaps, an analogy to be drawn between a vaccine schedule and a class schedule. For the sake of uniformity, it makes sense to have a uniform vaccine schedule by country or province or whatever. When you comply with the schedule for MMR, say, as a prerequisite for child day-care, you are relatively assured that other parents have, too. The rules for administration of a vaccine are uniform, too.Dosage and route are all fixed. Perhaps they are arbitrary, but the insert recommendations apply to all. Is possible to negotiate a personal schedule? Yes. Could the public health system afford to negotiate a personal schedule with everyone? No. So you have rules.Rules suck. I hate rules.I especially hate rules from professors that force me to read instructions and interfere with my social schedule. In my years of life, however, I have learned that they make things more efficient. Ronald Coase won the Nobel Prize for his observation that all rules can be bargained around; but it is cheaper when the rules reflect the reality of the situation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pTZ2oG2Y0cI hate the speed limit on my road. If I got a ticket, my chances of bargaining around the rule would be slim. ""I didn't see any sign,"" I would say. Judge says pay fine. ""The speed limit is too low,"" I would counter. Judge says pay fine. ""This law is unconstitutional,"" I retort. Judge asks if I want to go to jail for contempt.Same with class schedules and grading rules.

1600,1432170456,"Two separate considerations here:1) What is happening immunologically?2) What makes sense programatically?In reference to immunologically: One day before the first birthday is not likely to make a difference to the immune response/protection. The younger child, say around 6 months, you might need to think about interference from maternal antibodies. Generally speaking, during that first year of life, effectiveness of live viral vaccines needs to be considered in relation to the presence of maternal antibodies; however, maternal antibodies vary from mom to mom and, therefore, from infant to infant.In reference to programatically: Particularly because of school entrance laws, there has to be a cut-off. The CDC generally allows for a 4 day grace period; however, state laws and mandates may over-ride this:In clinical practice, vaccine doses occasionally are
administered at intervals less than the minimum interval or at
ages younger than the minimum age. Doses administered too
close together or at too young an age can lead to a suboptimal
immune response. However, administering a dose a few days
earlier the minimum interval or age is unlikely to have a substantially
negative effect on the immune response to that dose.
Vaccine doses administered days before the minimum interval
or age are considered valid; however, local or state mandates
might supersede this 4-day guideline.br />n certain situations, local or state requirements might mandate that doses of
selected vaccines be administered on or after specific ages. For example, a school
entry requirement might not accept a dose of MMR or varicella vaccine administered
before the child first birthday. ACIP recommends that physicians
and other health-care providers comply with local or state vaccination requirements

273,1429106084,"Prophylactic vaccination against rabies is advised when travelling to areas where rabies is endemic. However, boosters are required quite frequently to maintain protection against rabies long term: the schedule requires an initial three doses, a booster at one year, then further boosters at 3-5 year intervals after that. Even this does not provide full protection, and following contact with an animal suspected of carrying rabies, further doses of vaccine are required to stimulate the immune response. So in this case, prior vaccination won't necessarily be a 'cure' that allows anyone who has been vaccinated to be fully protected from rabies for life.Given also that vaccines are expensive to produce and purchase, may be difficult to store (e.g. require refrigeration/temperature control), and after a few years go out of date, it is not advisable for them to be on a country's vaccine programme if the disease is not present or prevalent there.

It was fortunate really that this happened to him in a town, rather than out in the countryside- where he may not have had such quick access to a doctor and/or the required treatment may not have been available.Interestingly, a few countries in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, for example) have a programme of rabies vaccination of wild animals via edible baits dropped from the air - the results of which will I am quite interested to see.",2.0

986,1430179280,"Information for context ... this is the information on infectivity (transmission, shedding) from native infection, pandemic H1N1TRANSMISSIONPerson-to-person transmission/span>Influenza viruses can be transmitted through sneezing and coughing via large-particle droplets [31]. In addition to respiratory secretions, certain other bodily fluids (eg, diarrheal stool) should also be considered potentially infectious [32]. In contrast to previous outbreaks of swine influenza viruses described above (see 'Historical perspective' above), the 2009 to 2010 pandemic of H1N1 influenza A infection demonstrated sustained human-to-human transmission, as suggested by the large numbers of patients with respiratory illnesses identified within a short period of time at various locations around the world [33]. Several of the isolates causing disease in the United States were found to be nearly genetically identical to isolates in Mexico, supportive of person-to-person transmission [2,34].Nosocomial transmission was observed between hospitalized patients, between healthcare providers, and from patients to healthcare providers [35,36]. Viral shedding/span>Similar to what has been observed with seasonal influenza, shedding of pandemic H1N1 influenza A was observed to begin the day prior to symptom onset and often to persist for five to seven days or longer in immunocompetent individuals [31,37-40]. Even longer periods of shedding occurred in children (especially young infants), elderly adults, patients with chronic illnesses, and immunocompromised hosts. Delayed clearance of virus from the nasopharynx was observed in patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or who had fatal disease [41]. The amount of virus shed was greatest during the first two to three days of illness.Various findings related to viral shedding were observed among patients infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza A, as illustrated by the following studies:lthough it is thought that immunocompetent patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus infection were likely to be contagious from one day prior to the development of signs and symptoms until resolution of fever, longer periods of shedding were detected in a study of United States air force academy cadets with confirmed or suspected pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection [37]. Of 29 samples that were obtained seven days following illness onset, seven (24 percent) contained viable H1N1 influenza virus.n a study that included 426 patients in China who were quarantined with pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus infection, the average duration of viral shedding was six days based upon real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) [38]. The median interval from resolution of fever to a negative rRT-PCR result was three days, with negative results occurring within seven days in 96 percent of patients. However, PCR techniques detect viral RNA, and not infectious virus, and may continue to be positive after viral cultures become negative.n a study that included 26 individuals (median age eight years) with proven pandemic H1N1 influenza A based upon positive rRT-PCR results during an elementary school-based outbreak in the United States, the median duration of viral shedding from fever onset was six days (range 1 to 13 days) by rRT-PCR and was five days (range one to seven days) by culture [40]. Following the resolution of fever, virus was isolated for a median of two days. n a study of 70 patients treated for pandemic H1N1 influenza A, most of whom had no comorbidities, the duration of viral shedding was reduced in patients who initiated oseltamivir therapy during the first three days of illness compared with those who began therapy on day four or later [39]. The mean duration of shedding from illness onset was five days among patients who began oseltamivir therapy during the first three days of illness, compared with seven days among those who began therapy on day four of illness, and 8.5 days among those who began therapy on day five of illness or later.",2.0

843,1429893735,"I feel like we need to address this issue if we're ever going to move the conversation forward. There is a lot of concern when it comes to whether or not vaccines are safe, whether the current schedule is safe, and whether or not vaccines cause x, y, or z. To preface this post, I think it's perfectly valid that people would want to know about safety. When your children are involved, you want what's best for them, and you don't want to cause them harm. I get it. I totally empathize. However, I feel that in general discourse, there are unrealistic expectations about safety, particularly in regard to medicine. I would like to use this thread to explore that issue. Risk is everywhere. We cannot control what happens in the universe. We can try to mitigate risk in various ways, and to some extent safety can always be improved and risk could always be shrunk. However, you're never going to completely eliminate risk or guarantee 100% safety. From a systems point of view, it's just never going to happen. So how does this relate to medicine? Every system in the body is related. If you do something to one system, it's inevitably going to affect another. That's unavoidable. So then you have to talk about risk vs. benefit. And that's really where I don't follow that logic of people who don't want to vaccinate, want alternative schedules, want to under-vaccinate, want to hold off until vaccines are safer, etc. Let's try a thought experiment. If your child needed an organ transplant, would you do it? Most parents, even those who are against or wary of vaccines, probably would to save their child's life. Even though such a procedure carries tremendous risks: risk of complications in surgery (infection, blood clots, blood loss) and risk of organ rejection. Yet most parents would take the risk because it's outweighed by the benefits. Now let's try another thought experiment. Let's say your child develops cancer. Would you try radiation and chemotherapy? Most people again probably would, even though we know that radiation and chemo drugs are toxic to healthy cells in the body. Because again, the risk is outweighed by the benefit. Now, does this mean that we shouldn't try to find safer cancer treatments? Or that we shouldn't strive to make surgery safer? No, obviously it does not. But that's not a reason to forgo these treatments in the present, because the scales are still tipped in the favor of benefit. The same logic can be applied to vaccines. Are their risks? Yes. Are those risks worse than contracting a deadly disease? No, they aren't. Just look at the numbers. The chances of experiencing an adverse reaction from a vaccine are smaller than the chances of getting the disease, especially if vaccination really starts to dip. A lot of people talk about ""natural immunity"" and how it's better than vaccination. They think that things like measles aren't really a big deal. ""My child is healthy, therefore measles won't kill him or her."" But how do you know that? Can you peer inside your child on the molecular level and evaluate their immune system? Their DNA? No, you can't. You can't predict how your child will react to a novel disease based on the fact that they don't seem to get colds often, or whatever qualitative measure people are using to announce the invulnerability of their child.So why take the risk? Let's grant just for one moment that all of the anti-vaxx assertions are true. Is it worse that your child develop allergies, or that they become sterile from mumps or blind/deaf from measles? Is it worse that your child develop a form of autism, or is it worse that they become paralyzed from polio? Is a seizure worse than the lockjaw induced by tetanus?I don't think that people really give this cost/benefit analysis much thought. They simply demand 100% safety, and that's never going to happen. They then use that to justify forgoing something that still provides more benefits than risks, simply for the fact that one day it could be done better. It doesn't make much logical sense, especially in light of how much data we have on vaccines at this point. We know vaccines prevent disease, and we know that by preventing disease we're preventing death. Logically, it's no different than performing that operation or undergoing those cancer treatments.
