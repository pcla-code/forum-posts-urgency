6220,1380969645,"Hi [REDACTED]!I am not sure I understood well your question. I will give it a try.&nbsp;(Here we will go a bit off topic.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful not to mix Accounting with Finance! They both manage the money of the company, but they have different role in the management.&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Inventory is: ''The raw materials, work-in-process goods and completely finished goods that are considered to be the portion of a business's assets that are ready or will be ready for sale.'' When we sell the goods the inventory becomes an expense.&nbsp;2. ''Inventory represents one of the most important assets that most businesses possess, because the turnover of inventory represents one of the primary sources of revenue generation and subsequent earnings for the company's shareholders/owners.'' Think what is happening when we hold too much/too little&nbsp;of inventory with the revenue and the earnings.&nbsp;PS. I used the Investopedia for the '' ''&nbsp;, cause I was not 100% sure if I can explain it well with my English. By the way, starting with Accounting classes is a very good idea.Accounting is the language of business, and the heart of business.&nbsp;Accounting is the preparation of accounting records -&nbsp;preparation, analyzing, and the interpretation of financial statements. Finance&nbsp;involves making decisions regarding working capital issues such as level of inventory, cash holding, credit levels, risk management, investment portfolios and etc. For all those decisions finance managers use accounting reports.

I started my working life as a prospective accountant back in 1983. Over the years, for a variety of reasons and motives, some have overstated and overstretched both the relevance and purpose(s) of financial accounting to commerce. From the standpoint of running a business, without a product or service customers want, you do not have a business. That is simply the harsh reality. As the old saying goes, if you have something other people want, they will beat the path to your door. Apple, the manufacturer of iPad on which I am writing this posting, is a good example.

9429,1383154993,"I think an example might be a machine using a two-stroke internal combustion engine to produce product. Such engines do not have oil pumps. They are lubricated by mixing motor oil into the gasoline. There is a separate motor oil reservoir which must be kept filled. The engine has a carburetor that mixes the oil and gasoline, then injects the mixture into the combustion cylinder. The gasoline is burned to produce work, which clearly makes it a product cost. The oil is not mainly burned to produce work, but is being used to lubricate the engine, a maintenance task. However, the amount of oil used by the engine is directly proportional to the amount of work the engine produces and can be matched to the production. So I would think the motor oil cost, though routine maintenance, would be a product cost rather than a period cost.",2

9436,1383158301,"Watch the videos again; it is mentioned.A company has to carry assets on their books at the lower of either purchase cost, or fair market value. If fair market value goes up the company still has to carry the asset on their books at the purchase cost less accumulated depreciation.When a company is acquired the acquiring company goes through books of the sold company and revalues everything possible to fair market value. Acquired assets carried on the books at purchase cost may be revalued up. This applies to all assets.When KP bought TK they went through TK's books and recalculated a current value for everything that was separable. Then they adjusted the all the values they could on the books, including the inventory. The difference between the aggregate revalued prices for assets and liabilities, and the purchase price, is what we know as goodwill. Goodwill isn't known until the acquired company's assets and liabilities are recalculated and compared to the acquisition price. Companies normally don't buy pre-existing goodwill with an acquisition; they may wind up with it after the acquisition if the purchase price is higher than the aggregate of revalued assets and liabilities.When applying the impairment test in the future goodwill may be determined to have fallen below the historical value, in which case it is written down. My observation from reading financial newspapers for many years is that goodwill is almost always written off sooner rather than later, generally as soon as the company has a good quarter and can write down goodwill but still show net income, and goodwill almost always represents overpayment for the company.",2

Let's take Harvard Business School as an example. According to their website, tuition costs alone are &gt;$50,000 (US). I won't argue with the marketplace value of a Harvard MBA degree, but a) how many of us could actually gain acceptance into their program? and b) would the marketplace value of the degree have a greater lifetime net benefit (increased income less cost of the degree) than the free version? Since the classes, courses and ideas being shared at Coursera are free, I believe that the benefit to someone like Anon aka [REDACTED] is infinitely greater simply because the lifetime net benefit (increased income less cost of $0) is positive from Day One.You might sense that the whole 'Free Education' idea is exciting to me because it removes the cost factor and makes education available to anyone who truly wants to learn.",2

Realized Gains are taxed at the end of the reporting period, and represent positive net of all gains/losses during the quarters. And with AFS method it's always clear what the final taxable amount will be, rather then with Trading method we would need to bring up all quarterly Income Statements (or find the original price instead).

10772,1384766775,"Anon:Thanks for the observations.&nbsp; It would appear we've got the same firm in-mind.&nbsp; An
 observation I've made previously is that describing something as a 
split does not necessarily inform one as to the impact of the event on 
the par value of the firm (although that does not seem in accord with the convention the Prof. is using in this class).&nbsp; A split can be effected in Delaware 
(modernly--in the time-frame we're discussing--understanding the issuer in question has now returned from Delaware to the jurisdiction of its roots):a.&nbsp; by a declaration 
of a dividend (which does not necessarily require a charter 
amendment)--which does not change the par value per share;b. by a reclassification of the stock (which may change the par value per share but need not); orc. in connection with a merger (which may change the par value per share but need not--I'll put aside a consolidation).As I recall, the
 term ""split"" does not actually appear in the pertinent 
Delaware statutory section.By way of illustration, below is a portion of the 
cover page of its 10-K filed 3/77, for fiscal year ended 12/76.&nbsp; If one were to back-out the par value for the stock at the end 
of 1976 by simply stringing-together the consequences of the splits, one
 would get a par value per share different from the actual as of that 
time:&nbsp; 16-2/3 cents per share.&nbsp; The cover page was relatively 
easy to get at a modest expense.&nbsp; Getting the full set of charter 
documents on file, to see precisely what happened in the intervening 
period as to the par value per share (before the move out-of-Delaware) 
is also straight-forward, albeit somewhat more costly (at least through a service), and I'm not entirely sure that Moody's Dividend Record would be sufficiently authoritative in this regard.&nbsp; But one supposes it will add nothing to the 
understanding--that one cannot simply equate a large split with a 
corresponding change in par value so that the aggregate par value of all
 stock remains the same.&nbsp; So, I'll elide the additional expense.Regards.",2

10577,1384542848,"Let me see if I can attempt to provide some clarity as to matters raised by your questions.&nbsp; You write, ""It is the expected profit from the option that is granted.""The Prof. said, ""The fair value estimate tries to take all of that into account.&nbsp; And there's a lot of sophisticated techniques, that we're not going to talk about to do this. The black-scholes model, the lattice binomial method. But for now just trust me that this fair&nbsp;value is indeed a fair value.""That is, the fair value estimates the value, to the holder, of the option as of the time of the grant.&nbsp; It's an option.&nbsp; It may end up being valuable in the sense of allowing the holder to realize money through exercise, because the stock price rises, and it can be exercised profitably.&nbsp; Or it may not. You write, "" Is it the yearly expected profit or the total profit?""Slide 4/5 for video 9-3 indicates ""Fair value of stock option grant ... This will be amortized over the vesting period."" It is the value of having the right, as of the time of receipt.&nbsp; It therefore represents the value of possible future pay-offs throughout its life (i.e., it is not ""yearly"").You write, ""Is it the expected profit no matter what year they sell it?""&nbsp; Well, this valuation is based as of the time of the grant.&nbsp; Of course, as of that time, no one knows when it will be exercised.&nbsp; You can look at the end of a text in corporate finance, and get a description and, depending on the text's audience, some detail.&nbsp; Or, you can take a peek at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes#The_Black.E2.80.93Scholes_equation, which may be adequately persuasive to take the Prof's word that the value will be some reasonably well-developed valuation and then move-on (understanding I'm not in finance, that's my move).As to why it's important:&nbsp; Since the company is expensing its value over time, it would could be important, particularly if it is a large value--and these can be quite large.That's the best I can do a the moment.&nbsp; I hope it is informative.",2
