It doesn??t matter if you trade in $ or Shares. You are just buying and selling a product/service that has a currency conversion.True sharing is something like couchsurfing, you do it without expecting any retribution.&nbsp;Also, sharing is an activity that doesn??t occur for pleasure for the receiving part, instead it??s due to a need.When i came to this realization i noticed that i was just gamifying ebay.So in the end we have:- Someone who NEEDS something from the system, and as such doesn??t need motivation because he is already extrinsically motivated.- Someone who wants to make profit from the system, and as such is already extrinsically motivated.If you don??t need anything you simply won??t partake in the activity.&nbsp;",2.0

There are 4 multiple-choice quizzes covering the material in the 
first four weeks of the course. (The material in the last two weeks is 
covered by the written assignments and the final.)  They are generally 
due at the end of the relevant week. The exception is the first quiz, 
which has a later deadline to accommodate students joining the course 
after the start date.
Quizzes may be resubmitted prior to the due date and you will receive
 credit for your highest score. However, after the first time you submit
 a quiz, your score on that attempt will be reduced by 20% for each 
subsequent submission.  In other words, you receive the full score for 
submission 1, only 80% of your score for submission 2, 60% for 
submission 3, and so forth.
As explained in the introduction to the quizzes, some of the 
questions have one correct answer (radio buttons). Others, however, ask 
you to check off all of the correct answers from a provided list.  On 
these ""checkbox"" questions, you gain credit for correct answers and lose
 credit for incorrect answers, so choose carefully.

Assignment #2 in accordance with the very first few words of the task
(""Describe in general terms""). I was thorough in my discussion of
intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation and touched based on the types of tools
we could use; but admittedly
didn't get into the weeds regarding specific tools or calorie/point algorithms.

I almost wish the question had been: ""Be as specific as you
can in describing a gamification system..."" I would have at least had a
chance, then, of being on the same page as peer graders who couldn't follow the
directions themselves and then felt I ""didn't give enough specific
examples"". 

I'm still learning a great deal from the class and it's not about the score per
se. But in this case, it IS my feedback and takes a little fun out of my
personal continuous education - which otherwise is intrinsically valuable to me.

Here what I understood this to mean.  
What are shares and for whom?   Shares would be like say coins that you get for arcade game. Or in video games.  Where you spend real money to buy the coins and use the to purchase other things like a ride in the simulator machine or exchange coins in a video game for food.  The shares are used by anyone wanting to share there stuff.
With whom are shares traded? With other people that participate in the Shareall tool.  They are other people that want to share items in particular countries or states near you.  Look at the example sites for zipcar it might help.
Is it between users and people listing their assets? Yes
How does Shareall charge for the assets?  Using the shares as money the person listing tell them the price they want to use the item.  I would think shares means you don&#39;t have to worry about conversion rates for different currency.  That would be done when you buy your shares.
I hope this helps!

8411,1367233788,"The task was about designing the system. Imo you didn't do it.I can share my work to show you how I did it.Let's change our cityMy idea of a gamification system to motivate city employees to loose weight is running an internal loyality program called&nbsp;""Let's change our city"". Every employee can get points for:Ordering healthy food in cafeteriaParticipating in a sport competition (like marathon/bike race etc.)Visiting a gymRunning/cycling (GPS tracking)Going to work by bikeMonthly wegith check (a lots of points when you loose weigth, some when you keep your weight, none when you gain weigth)Completing health related quests&nbsp;Winning individual (or group) challenges between employees (or departments)Extra points for motivating someone else (doing activities in pairs or groups)According to Mayor [REDACTED]'s office economists city can save a lot of money if it's employees loose weight (US$188 million with 5% fit improvement). Proposed gamification system will use this money as an inderect motivation. I assume that saved money can be used in many different ways (probably Mayor [REDACTED] has a lot of ideas), but I think that we need to do something to keep people&nbsp;motivated&nbsp;and&nbsp;spread the motivation&nbsp;not only among the&nbsp;employees, but also among&nbsp;citizens. To do that city should use saved money to&nbsp;promote healthy life&nbsp;by building&nbsp;sport centers, swimming pools, jogging parks, gyms, organising sport competitions, races etc. As we can see there is plenty possibilities to promote healthy life and people fitness. My gamification system will use points collected while living healthy life as&nbsp;votes for deciding what to spend it on. So employees (at the begining) and ctizens (if this loyality program spreads outside city employment group) will&nbsp;decide&nbsp;what kind of healthy life promotion should be done. Maybe they want a new jogging park, maybe they want a swimming pool or maybe they want something else. They will decide. If city decides to make the program available to all the citizens - they can all decide how their city will change.How this system motivatesExtrinsic motivation:top weight-losers will become a faces of public healthy life campaign (it's also intrinsic in my opinion)monthly challenges: winners will get free acces to the gym/swimming pool for the next monthpower to decide (more points you get the more votes you have)&nbsp;Intrinsic&nbsp;motivation:social factor of gamification - working in pairs/groups to win challenges with different department/group; individual challenges between friends/co-workers; leaderboards (comparing to my friends or closest co-workers)an app which will collect information about completed activities (jogging, working out etc.) and prodive it's users an information how this particular activity influenced user's health; this app can also show how user's health will improve when he reaches target weightmoney saved by the city will go for the good cause (building public pro-health/pro-fit infrastructure)we can send e-mail/SMS messages to the employees with information when his/her friend/co-worker is doing healthy activity (may motivate to do te same)What I liked was...peer 1 ???&nbsp;Giving employees voting power in deciding how the saved money is spent is good idea.peer 2 ???&nbsp;you're the 3rd student I rate for now and it's my absolute favorite, you considered all the important points, added nice, bold words, so it's easy to read and you didn't forget anything!peer 3 ???&nbsp;it sounded like fun!!!peer 4 ???&nbsp;A well defined system as well as the motivators are well thought of.peer 5 ???&nbsp;how detailed is the planWhat could have made this submission better was...peer 1 ???&nbsp;Some of the example under intrinsic motivation were actually extrinsic motivators, otherwise good.

613,1364852204,"For me, the game that was most memorable for me was Tales of Symphonia. It was the first RPG game I'd ever played in my life (before then, the games I usually played were action, puzzle and platformers, and though I'd played Pokemon before ToS I didn't understand or acknowledge that Pokemon was also an RPG) and what made it different than ALL the games I'd played from the age of 4 until the age of 13 when I initially played that game--was the depth of which the story affected me. Symphonia was the first game that knocked my perception of games. Before it, games were a fun activity that I'd do alone when bored or play with my brother when I wanted sibling companionship. But when I played that game--expecting it to be like any other game I'd played--and was hit upside the head with the realization that woah, games could do this to people? Games could make you think? Affect you on such a deep and personal level that they can change your world perceptions of yourself and other people? For me, that was mindblowing at the time. And it was also the defining contributing factor to me wanting to be a game designer, because I want to make games like it someday.Since it's part of a series, other games in the series also have a similar effect. Every game focuses on some major issue or defining concept and creates a story and game around it and I find that I learn many interesting things from every installment, but Tales of Symphonia was my first Tales game and because of its level of impact it'll always be the most special game for me.So, I guess, to answer the question of what makes a game memorable, it would be the story--or whatever part of the game creates an emotional impact on the player to such a degree that they can still remember it for years and years after initially playing it. Back then, at that age, I was struggling with a lot of personal issues and suicidal ideations because I'd spent a large part of my life feeling like my life was insignificant and that I had no value to anyone and things along those lines--and I'll never forget the feeling I had when in the context of the story the main character, Lloyd, told various other characters at varying times that their (my) lives DID have meaning, that you DO have purpose, that no life exists for the sole purpose of dying and that it wasn't me who was wrong but the people who'd made me think like this. That it was nothing that I did or said that made them do the things they did to me, it was because their hearts were weak. Before then, I'd never heard anyone say those things, and because of the nature of playing a game, it felt like he was talking directly to me. That, in my opinion, is how games can be powerful while at the same time being engaging and fun.Ah...I tried to keep this short but I ended up rambling fvhjfvbfd.
