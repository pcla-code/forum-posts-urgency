Here you go, [REDACTED].  The combinatorial character of the problem is seen most clearly by application of Lord Kelvin's method of images (pioneered originally by D. André).  You can set up a simple recurrence by arguing about what the penultimate step should be.

Here is an example of the kind of result that is attainable.  Consider a slightly simpler setting where the gambler starts with wealth \(k\) and plays indefinitely until his wealth runs out. The probability that, starting with an initial wealth of \(k\), the gambler is bankrupted at the \(n\)th step is given by
\[
  \frac{k}n \binom{n}{\frac{n+k}2} 2^{-n}.
\]
(Of course, \(n\) and \(k\) must both be even or both odd: the gambler can be bankrupted on step \(n\) only if \(n+k\) is even.)  This is the famous ballot theorem of W. A. Whitworth.  Verify:
 If \(k = n\) we obtain \(2^{-n}\), as we should, as the gambler must lose at each of \(n\) trials in succession to lose on the \(n\)th step.
 If \(k=0\) then the probability is zero.  The gambler starts out bankrupt and will not be allowed to play.
 If \(k=1\) it is already non-trivial.  The probability of bankruptcy on the \(n\)th trial, given a starting wealth of \(k=1\), evaluates to
\[
  \frac1n\binom{n}{\frac{n+1}2} 2^{-n}.
\]
(Of course, \(n\) has to be odd.)  The expression does not simplify further but is estimated well by Stirling's formula when \(n\) is large by
\[
  \frac1n\binom{n}{\frac{n+1}2} 2^{-n} \thicksim \sqrt{\frac2\pi}\cdot n^{-3/2} \qquad (n\to\infty).
\]
The asymptotic equivalence sign \(\sim\) means that the ratio of the two terms tends to one as \(n\to\infty\).  So, if the gambler starts out with unit wealth his probability of lasting until the \(n\)th step before being bankrupted decays quite fast with \(n\): the probability decays as \(n^{-3/2}\).
 
You can fold in a termination condition where the gambler leaves with his winnings if his wealth reaches a given value \(N\) into the framework as well.

If you can get hold of a copy of my text in the local library you will find the analysis for simple random walk in pages 44 46 and 244 247; biased versions and return to the origin questions are in pages 546 560.  Feller's books also contain this material though it's spread across volumes 1 and 2.

579,1448646928,"
It's a nice question,[REDACTED].  What Boole gives us at the expense of a weaker bound is freedom from constraints.  And it is already remarkable that something can be said in such generality.  Adding constraints on the colouring should in principle yield tighter results.  But it's not going to be easy.

The simplest example of the kind of simply connected scenario you have in mind is in the unit circle \(\mathbb{S}^1\) where we can directly see the necessary and sufficient condition on a monochromatic arc length to include the vertices of a square.  A similar argument improves the 50% lower bound on \(\mathbb{S}^2\) and should be tight.  If we break simple connectivity then things get ugly very fast and I don't know of any general results which are tight (but a Google search may be worth trying).  I could imagining using something like the Lovsz local lemma or, perhaps better even, Janson's inequalities to improve on Boole's bound but this will entail at minimum second moment calculations.  And without sufficient structure these will be unpleasant.  \(\mathbb{S}^1\) should provide a sanity check for an approach.

I've been watching this unfold with some interest.  As [REDACTED] astutely pointed out in his opening broadside, there can be, and is, a pedagogical incentive occasionally for me to heighten a sense of paradox.  Undoubtedly, a pleasant sense of being surprised increases engagement and a desire to learn what may otherwise be perceived as a dry and forbidding subject.  I will use such artifices rarely but with the objective of engagement always in mind.  If overdone, however, it risks confusing the student and may actually deter engagement with the subject.  Aside from such occasional and rare motivational ploys, as a general rule I abhor sophistic arguments and attempt, insofar as I am able, to present the subject to the student in the same clear and pellucid light as I see it, shorn of mysticism and imbued with a sense of wonder at the power and subtlety of simple ideas.  You will have to form your own judgements as to whether I have got the balance right.  

Let me weigh in with two comments on the subject that has been so vigourously debated here.

Language can be tricky and even native speakers may walk away with subtly differing views of what was expressed depending upon their backgrounds, experience, and the linguistic traditions to which they have been exposed.  I cannot claim to be a native speaker of the language but I have taught at [REDACTED] for nigh on 30 years.  And after all this time I still occasionally bemuse, or even outright confuse, my colleagues with a turn of phrase or usage.  My poor students.  For what it is worth, my own interpretation of the disputed phrase is the one that [REDACTED] espouses.  But, as is evident from the impassioned discussion, folks of good faith may come to different interpretations.  So, are we at an impasse?  Not so, I think.

Problems of any heft, especially where there is a real-life application in view, are inevitably couched in language, frequently less than precise, and sadly incomplete in its specification.  But the fact that we do not start with a mathematically precise statement does not absolve us of the responsibility of attempting to model it in a precise, ideally mathematical, formulation.  In developing the model we keep in mind two principles: 1) strip away obfuscating and irrelevant detail; and, 2) take into account all the essential features.  The first is so that we end up with a problem of manageable complexity; the second so that we actually end up saying something useful for the problem at hand.  In practice, these aphorisms are easier to espouse than to put into practice.  In a birthday problem I may make the facile (and factually incorrect) assumption that every year has 365 days and birthdays are uniformly distributed across the year: this strips away pettifogging detail which is not ultimately critical.  But it would be a mistake to assume sampling of birthdays is without replacement as that removes an essential feature of the problem at hand.  And in the question that has sparked this post, my own inclination, naturally, would be to take things at face value with the idea that, for a first cut at least at the problem, how the data were arrived at may be of secondary interest, at least initially, while we set things up and see how they go.  But this is a matter of judgement and good folks may well disagree.  Ultimately, any attempt at modelling must be subject to the dispassionate assessment of the reader.

So, can we eliminate the ambiguity and begin, as [REDACTED]suggests, with a precise mathematical statement right from the start?  There are two objections to this.  The first, as pointed out above, is that most real problems are couched in language and have ambiguity baked into the cake.  While we will of course examine precisely stated toy problems with a view to making a concept crystal clear, for most students the motivation for examining a dry mathematical subject comes from real-world experiences and applications and we may as well learn as we go along that ambiguity is a feature of problems and make our best fist of modelling them.  The second objection is simply that, in my experience, an overly precise attempt at stating a problem not only gives it a patina of artificiality, but, a dry as dust description puts my students to sleep.  So we're back to engagement.  But this is again subjective and a matter of personal preference.  For me, I love mathematical precision, and I simultaneously love language with all its colour and ambiguity.  And I do my best to balance my two loves.

I should say that it delights me to watch students of a subject involved in impassioned discussions for that augurs a level of engagement that is wonderful.  For my part I view myself as a tour guide exposing my students to a beautiful mathematical city.  If I am a good tour guide I may be able to create a story that is fascinating, perhaps even memorable, and imprint the essential mathematical monuments and figures indelibly on the mind.  But this can only be the bare bones of the city in the time available for the guided tour: a short visit to Paris and a view of the Avenue des Champs-?lys?es, the Louvre, Notre Dame, and the Place de la Bastille with, perhaps, a side helping of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror.  To get a true appreciation of the rhythms, contours, and unexpectedly rich and unique aspects of the city, a student will have to immerse herself in it and persist with the exploration well after the guided tour has ended: the small museums, the treasures that can be found in the small bookstores along the Seine, the alleyways in Montmartre, the devotees of Paris St. Germain's brand of football, the storied Roland??arros, and, above all, the cafes.  A really good tour guide could hope to inspire such devotion.  As teachers we all aspire to this though, of course, most of us sadly fall short.

I have enjoyed your discussion and I have no wish to throttle or impede it.  But let me suggest two more problems to add fuel to the fire.

1) In the familial problem suppose that we start by saying that in the performance of a decennial census a household known to have two children is visited by a government employee.  A knock at the door is answered by a boy.  What is the chance that the other child is a boy?  [I could make an argument for any answer between 1/3 and 1 but I'll let you see what you make of it.]

2) A man puts a certain sum of money into one trouser pocket and double that sum into the other trouser pocket.  You don't know what the sums are or how they are distributed ahead of time but you do know that one sum is twice the other.  He then pulls out the money from his left pocket and shows you that he has $x in that pocket.  He offers to give you the money or, if you wish instead, to give you whatever sum is in his other pocket.  What is your best strategy?  [One simple argument might be that the other pocket contains either $2x or $x/2 with equal probability.  So, if you elect blindly to take the money in the other pocket without knowing in advance what it contains then you will make, on average, $$\frac12\cdot \frac{x}2 + \frac12\cdot 2x = \frac{5x}4$$ which of course exceeds $$x$$.  Paradox?]

I will end this post here as I see that I have to go to class now and will end up, no doubt, confusing my doctoral students.  On tap today is a story of history and empire, the peregrinations of a mosquito, a Nobel on explorations of black holes, why two violins are twice as loud as one violin, and what connects all these in the development of the mathematical theory of random walks.  So we should have fun, confusion or no.

9,1443856661,Hello from [REDACTED].I like to take courses about math and computer science. I'm looking forward to learn more about probability.,1
638,1449391670,"Dear Dr. [REDACTED],In September 2014, as a first-year undergraduate, I enrolled in an online MOOC called ""Probability"". At that time, I really had no idea what probability meant, except for the bits that I've learnt in Professor [REDACTED]. I glanced over the first two weeks of material already posted - that was such an incredible long list. Fear of not being able to finish all the material, I quitted this class, hoping to make an eventual return.After that, I started my first year in university, taking honors math as a challenge. Later I also started to study fundamentals of computer algorithms and data structures on my own through MOOCs. I started to get into contact with probability - pdfs, expectations, variance, independence, etc. Some of these concepts, such as expectations, probability as an integral are pretty straight forward, but some are rather more complicated, as I really don't have a good understanding of independence when receiving a crash course on the subject for a proof of an algorithm's efficiency. In any case, I found myself in the need to learn subject in a more ""systematic"" approach, and promised myself to take a MOOC on it.I was excited to find out that this MOOC was back in the fall of 2015. I promptly enrolled and even verified my course work. Indeed, a large of material was covered each week, and sometimes I found it difficult to grasp all content in a short period of time. However, eventually I got used to the pace of the course. I kept on looking forward to each week's material to arrive, simply because of how much it resembled a great novel to me. All concepts are explained in thorough depth, derived and proved step-by-step and illustrated using fascinating examples, and new materials are connected to past content very well. The homework problems really get one to think about the concepts and go over the mathematical derivations - there is nothing more that a amatuer fan of mathematics can demand for, except perhaps for the course to span for a longer period, so that one can have a chance to explore all the material thoroughly.As this course was coming to an end, I realized that I have gained more than the foundations in probability from this course. I am even more intrigued by the beauty of mathematics, and keen on continuing my studies in more advanced probability/mathematics. Furthermore, I also started to tackle new problems and ideas at a slower pace to absorb the content better. The course has provided me with many invaluable insights, much beyond what is stated in the course syllabus.I have always thought that having an outstanding mathematical professor is perhaps one of the best gift one can receive on his way to explore the world. I am truly grateful that you have decided to offer this course to students around the world. It is truly my honor to learn this material from you.?Thank you very much.Sincerely,[REDACTED]",2

452,1447341626,"
Bear in mind,[REDACTED], that every mass function has to be non-negative [the positivity axiom] and that the atomic probabilities (the masses) have to add to $$1$$ [the normalisation axiom].  This implies, among other things, that no individual mass function can be everywhere above another mass function.  If that were possible than the sum of probabilities for the dominating function would have to be larger than the sum of probabilities for the dominated mass function and so at least one of the two would have to violate the normalisation axiom.  In general, hence, two different mass functions are not directly comparable: they will each spread unit mass around in different ways and each of them will have to be bigger than the other somewhere.

What does this observation say about binomial probabilities?  Recall that the binomial distribution has a unimodal character, first increasing to a maximum at a point or two adjacent points, then decreasing.  The distribution peaks near its expected value. Thus, the function $$b_{100}(k; 0.3)$$ peaks at the value $$k = 30$$, the function $$b_{100}(k; 0.5)$$ peaks at the value $$k = 50$$, and the function $$b_{100}(k; 0.8)$$ peaks at the value $$k = 80$$.  The following table lists the truncated values of each of these mass functions at each of these points.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l|lll}
b_{100}(k; p) &amp; k = 30 &amp; k = 50 &amp; k = 80\\\hline
p = 0.3 &amp; 0.0868 &amp; 2.3\times 10^{-5} &amp; 4.3\times 10^{-27}\\\hline
p = 0.5 &amp; 1.3\times 10^{-5} &amp; 0.0796 &amp; 1.6\times 10^{-11}\\\hline
p = 0.8 &amp; 6.3\times 10^{-25} &amp; 4.2\times 10^{-10} &amp; 0.0993
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Because of the rapid decay of the binomial distribution away from its centre, each column contains one moderately large probability near 10% (for the distribution achieving its maximum value there) but the corresponding probabilities at this location for the other two distributions are tiny as the location is far from their centres.  The three figures in Tableau 10.1: c make this very evident graphically.  If $$n$$ is smaller the storyline remains the same but the probabilities will not have decayed so dramatically fast as you discovered in your numerical investigation.

Intuition can be tricky when learning a new subject.  And this seems to be particularly the case for the mathematical science of probability.  But this is not at all unusual.  As we explore further, we get better at seeing problems in the right perspective and our refined intuition ripens with experience.

585,1448720609,"
Yes, indeed, [REDACTED].  Your observation is perceptive.  In practice, especially when sample sizes are relatively small and the underlying distribution is discrete, the normal approximation picks up a ""discretisation"" error at the end points of integration.  A statistician will occasionally attempt to improve matters slightly by employing what is called a continuity correction which attempts to cancel opposing errors on either side of an end point in the integral.

In practice, however, we should employ such approximations with caution.  The other sources of uncertainty and error in the modelling (independence, bias, and so on) may well be more significant.  An apt slogan: When \(n\) is small, proceed with care.  A rule of thumb (which itself should be viewed with caution) is that \(npq\) should be at least \(10\); for a fair coin this translates into \(n\) about \(40\).

To make assurance doubly sure we will want to provide an error estimate as well, and error estimates are indeed available via the Berry??ss?en inequalities, for instance.  But the theory behind them gets much more arduous.

sum(p)
Out[5]: 0.9999999999999998
We see that these probabilities sum up to just about 1. Are we dealing with a rounding error, or have we missed something in our counting? Let's make sure:sum(x)

Here is a pie chart of the distribution:Incidentally, a naive approach to answering this question might be to enumerate all $$365^{23}$$ possible outcomes and then categorize each according to how many of the 23 people are involved in duplications. Assuming we can analyze 1 million outcomes per second, this would take $$365^{23} \div 1,000,000 \div 60 \div 60 \div 24 \div 365 = \underline{2.7 \times 10^{45}}$$ years!Here is a distribution plot for $$n=30$$:And for $$n=40$$:",2
599,1448847584,I cannot express enough my gratitude for this course. It will be archived in my computer and devoured properly.A big up to the people who did the subtitles. They/he/she offered me a ton of laughs with some amazing renditions. (big help to get me trhu all the videos).Thanks to prof. Venkatesh and the rest of the crew.This is just the end of the beggining for my excursion to probability land.,1
159,1445094196,"I did something similar (but not as developed) in python for practice:from random import randint

tosses = 100000
heads = sum(randint(0,1) for _ in range(tosses))

print 'Tosses: ', tosses
print 'Heads %:', 100.0*heads/tosses
Output:
Tosses: 1000 
Heads %: 48.1 

Tosses: 10000 
Heads %: 49.66

Tosses: 10000000 
Heads %: 50.01825

I find that it takes a surprisingly large number of tosses to get close to 50% consistently. ?For instance, even 1000 tosses can be off by 2% like in the results above.

413,1447142117,"It is certainly starting to seem to me that, in discussing the relationships we find in analyzing repeated independent trials, we should always check to see if we cannot take advantage of the presence of a recursion in deriving useful expressions. Does the applicability of recursion arise directly from the repeated independent trials? Is this a tautology, or something else?I think I see something dimly, here, but I'm just not sure.",4

384,1446905246,"Hi [REDACTED], in the previous posts I was referring to the optional part of the problem.For the not optional Q7 yes?I passed the grader.?For this part, you have to consider a sequence of?coin tosses. For the coin the probability of success (=at least one hit per game) must be determinated starting from the known probability to get an hit for any given ""at bat"".",3
