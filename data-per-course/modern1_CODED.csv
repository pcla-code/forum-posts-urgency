Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
You essay does a good job of addressing points 1-3 in the rubric. I really like your observation about poetry possibly being more epansive that painting--it's an arguable point, but a good one. You also did a nice job describing the similarities between poetry and paintg.
i enjoying reading your essay-thank you

I'm new to the course and have hurtled through week 1 & 2 over 48 hours, including one essay, so perhaps my brain is fried, but whilst really enjoying the course, I'm finding the reductive nature of the quizzes a little problematic, some it this may just be, I'm not in a find the right answer mode, or indeed even, a read the questions properly mode.  However, I disagree with some of the instances of what is considered to be the 'right' answer.  The example I want to share, relates to the the 'at desk' question in the second week quiz.  I think you can argue, as I would, that her omission of my or a, can be considered as making the desk non-personal, and that doesn't negate that it is also personal.  Both meanings can co-exist within the poem.  She is referring to her own desk, and so it is personal, but by the same token, by describing herself as 'at desk, she is responding to her grandfather's imperative get 'a trade' and so is expressing that she is in a state of being 'at work' , and when she is ""at work"", she is 'at desk', rather that at mill, or factory, or office, and that this generalised impersonal place, such as a factory would be described, is translated into her world as being 'at desk'. Thereby operating as a statement of I am 'at work', my desk is my work, as an answer to the implied criticism from the grandfather to learn a trade.  Both meanings, the personal and the generalised, I would argue provides more resonance, and more layers of meaning and and references the broader context of the traditional world of work, and the language used to describe it.

A close look at nearly every word, but the structure of the essay itself is rather rigid and predictiable. Although the essay has a clear overall purpose, it lacks a life of its own, being too dependent on the poem under consideration. Instead, follow your own train of thought and let the structure of your essay emerge of its own accord rather than adhere to a simple blueprint.

The essay&nbsp; is more than paraphrasing the poem , and I agree with her/him that poet is in spiritual hangover . It's a very short essay and I think&nbsp; it leaves some points that can be discuss more.

The essay does not talk anything about the dashes which are frequently used in the Emily's poems


Essay does not talk anything about the stanzaic form of the poem . However its talk about the figurative drukenness of the speaker.


the essay talks about the poets love of nature ,but there are some other points that needed more analysis.


The essay does not talk about the shifting metaphor.


Overall its a good effort and it will help us to know more about the poem .

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Emily Dickenson's poem &ldquo;I taste a liquor never brewed&rdquo; turns the image of being staggeringly drunk to a surprisingly positive, even redemptive, experience. The poem is a ballad, a form which evokes the drinking songs heard in the taverns and inns where one would expect an &ldquo;Inebriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Debauchee&rdquo; to spend time. Dickenson, however, turns the ballad into a lofty exultation in the joy of beauty and nature, with the four stanzas evoking the four seasons. The excess in the poem is not alcoholic debauchery but an overflowing joy that lifts the drunkard up to heaven.
In the first stanza, the immediate mention of alcohol-related terms &ldquo;liquor,&rdquo; &ldquo;brew[ing],&rdquo; &ldquo;Tankards,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vats upon the Rhine&rdquo; evokes images of darkened taverns and swigs of beer. At the same time, the first stanza includes the disconcerting image of &ldquo;Tankards scooped in Pearl,&rdquo; where &ldquo;Pearl&rdquo; evokes refinement, luxury and wealth&mdash;opposite associations from those of the other beery language. Pearl also evokes the 'pearly gates' of the Christian vision of heaven. ED claims in this stanza to be drinking a liquor that is superior to any physical alcohol.&nbsp;What might this &ldquo;liquor never brewed&rdquo; be?
The poet reveals in the second stanza that it is &ldquo;Air&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dew&rdquo; which are rendering her an &ldquo;Inebriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Debauchee.&rdquo; Rather than getting drunk at night in closed quarters, the poet is &ldquo;Reeling &ndash; thro endless summer days&rdquo;: drunk off of the bright blue sky (&ldquo;Molten Blue&rdquo;) and the prodigal abundance of summer. Nature creates in her effects reminiscent of drunkenness: euphoria, dis-inhibition, poor balance (i.e. deviation from society's straight and narrow ideology). The exploration of inebriation in nature continues in the next stanza, where we encounter &ldquo;the drunken Bee&rdquo; being turned out of its foxglove residence, and Butterflies that are swearing off their whiskey. In contrast to the Bee and Butterfly, though, the poet says she &ldquo;shall but drink the more!&rdquo; That is, even if nature rebukes the bees for being drunk on life, and even if butterflies decide to sober up, ED will only &ldquo;drink&rdquo; more, rather than being discouraged. When the summer days turn to autumn drear, the inebriation will continue.
In the last stanza, the poet reveals the end of her drinking, introduced with the word &ldquo;Till.&rdquo; The scene the drinker is waiting, even longing, for, includes Seraphs celebrating and the Saints running eagerly to their windows: distinctly religious imagery that evokes Heaven. The Seraphs with their ""snowy Hats"" (winter) are traditionally considered highest angels, who are &ldquo;associated with light, ardor and purity&rdquo; (Oxford American Dictionary), and the Saints are extraordinarily good and holy followers of God, well-respected and revered&mdash;the opposite of drunkards who are despised. The poet says she will drink until these holy characters run to their windows (how undignified and childlike!), &ldquo;to see the little Tippler&rdquo; (the poem's habitual drinker, presumably Emily). How peculiar to see the Saints running to see a degenerate drunk! But here the Tippler isn't degenerate or immoral, because the &ldquo;liquor&rdquo; isn't a physical alcohol but is the distillation of life, joy, energy itself.
And the little Tippler is &ldquo;Leaning against the &ndash; Sun --&rdquo;! The leaning reveals a drunk who can't hold herself up, thus is leaning, i.e. depending, on someone else&mdash;a picture of spiritual or emotional dependence, neediness. Leaning against someone is also a sign of intimacy with that person. The drunk&nbsp;leans against &ldquo;the &ndash; Sun &ndash;"". The physical Sun is light, heat, source of warmth and energy, the basis for all of life. &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; has religious or spiritual symbolism as well, which is bolstered by its juxtaposition with the Seraphs and Saints. Like the physical Sun, Christ or God is the source of life and light, warmth and joy and abundance, in Christianity, and ED may be punning on Son/Sun here since Christ is considered the Son of God (and the Son of Man) and is often referred to simply as the Son.
It seems, then, that the poet's inebriation brings her into a deeper connection with life, and even into a more intimate and dependent relationship with God, where she leans up against Him while the saints and angels look on and cheer. This meaning is not immediately obvious upon a first reading of the poem, but emerges to a reader who take the time to &ldquo;drink in&rdquo; the implications of each word and image. The poet never directly names the liquor that inebriates her, nor the setting of the final scene. Even the identity of the Sun is veiled. The meaning of the poem is open to one who is also &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; on the air and sky as the poet is, but it is closed to anyone not willing to &ldquo;reel&rdquo; through the &ldquo;endless summer days&rdquo; of nature and of poetry. The inebriation of light and life brings many rewards, from the humble opening of this poem to the sublime opening of Heaven.

3255,1347360283,"That's a great point [REDACTED]. And I think you really hit the nail on that head when bringing up the topic of translation verses interpretation. I find that very often when teaching literature or poetry to my English learners. I think something that really highlights this difference is the amount of connotations some words possess, as to say depending on the definition you favor your interpretation will clearly differ. I have seen this in poetry analysis with my advanced students. They all have a slightly different definition in mind and with that they see the text in a completely different way in comparison to their peers.",1

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
Yes, I think you see the problems in v1 from the imagist manifesto point of view. But I think you might be a little harsh. I mean. . .he decided not to publish it. It is a draft and takes him towards the final. I also think you might want to reconsider your view on ""story."" An image (in fact Imagism) can reveal a scene or image that tells a story or even a fragment of a story. The poem has emotion. It has possibility. And. . . this poem has two characters that interact in a very special way in a special moment. And it's very important for the appreciation of the poem to not neglect it. &nbsp;

Your ""close reading"" of the poem contained much of the same summer-like energy that was contained in the original piece. You seem to have a natural exhuberance for things like flowers and insects and sunshine, and your writing reveals a heart for nature. Your image of ED outside dancing with her arms extended in appreciation of summer's natural beauty is a great observation about the ""story"" of the speaker. I think you are rlght in your assessment that this poem is not just about summer, but something more eternal and spiritual. (heaven, goodness) I really your speculation at the end of &nbsp;your essay suggesting that the little tippler may indeed be a sunflower. How appropriate.&nbsp;

This particularly essay brought a interpretation really close to a literal meaning to the whole poem. Of course, there's some bold lines of thinking that improve the text, just like:""...the little tippler in her state of wonderful natural intoxication, as the poet leans against the sun like a drunk against a lamp post""; it was a differential to enrich the metaphor understanding. The liquor was interpreted as a special kind ok drink, the poet was identified in some word assets (""I"" and ""the little Tippler"") and the paper does a special reference about the dashes: ""The poem contains numerous dashes and breaks giving it a staggering or drunken feel, like the flights of butterflies and bees, or the gate of someone who has had too much to drink.( It is interesting to note that there are other publications of this poem in books and other media that have smoothed out the appearance of the poem by removing the dashes and replacing some of them with commas.This seems even more remarkable since this is one of the few poems published during Dickenson's lifetime. It would be interesting to see what the actual original manuscript looks like.""&nbsp; This definitly was a differential. And Emily experience on drinking liquor was compared to her personal thought on nature, a kind of fascination and splendor equal to the liquor debuchee result that justifies the essay's title. &nbsp;The whole text explored in a compact manner all Emily's intentions on the poem. Wasn't a superficial reading, but was placed in some common notions about this particular Dickinson's work. Even so, it's a good one.

81896,1352806858,"In response to Bernadette Mayer's ideas of experimentation I have used a personal poem. This poem seemed as if it could conform to the New York School by dealing with every day events using plain language. It does not conform because I have imposed meaning. However, it is based on an experience no one would know unless I recorded it. It is an attempt to write ""something that has never been written before.""

FOR MY BROTHER, THE MONK,

WHO WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE THERE

The last time I saw them together, 

our father had a feeding tube. 

At home, our mother made his meals a feast 

as she always did for us.

I saw her pull her wheelchair close to his.

One of her hands lifted a can of Ensure;

the other that life-saving, transparent snake.

She began to pour. They didn't pray or give

any kind of thanks, but she turned to me,

saying, ""This is how we lap dance.""

Remember how deeply blue her eyes were?

A deeper blue in death, her eyes that day

were full of an intimacy we never knew existed

behind their bedroom door.

In response to this assignment's prompt I eliminated all prepositonal phrases as I tend to use them a lot. I was interested in seeing if the poem made sense or was improved. Here is what was left:

The last time I saw them together,

our father had a feeding tube.

Our mother made his meals a feast

I saw her pull her wheelchair close.

One hand lifted a can,

any kind, but she turned,

saying, ""This is how we lap dance.""

Remember how deeply blue her eyes were?

A deeper blue, her eyes that day

were full we never knew existed.

As I studied the results of the experiment I saw the poem, while awkward in some places, had become pleasantly condensed. It was clear I was trying to present an image. I thought of Williams and the Imagists. Without the prepositional phrases I could see the bones of the poem. How much flesh did I want to put on? Did I even like the former version? I would leave out the prepositional phrases in my next revision. I would also leave out punctuation but keep capitals at the beginning of each complete thought. Word choice and order became more important. I read the poem aloud which I often forget to do. The word ""did"" in line 4 sounded harsh; I replaced it with the softer ""had."" I realized using the word ""intimacy"" wasn't necessary if I could show it; hence, the  addition of ""their knees touched."" I saw the poem could be written in couplets. My parents' beautiful, but irreligious, ritual became a kind of eucharistic celebration. I didn't need the words ""life-saving."" ""Transparent snake"" would do. ""Can"" was replaced with ""cup"" and my mother's words were ""offered"" reinforcing the image of communion. Hopefully, the poem now presented a simple, but active image- an icon for my brother. I could now change the title.  The use of Mayer's prompting freed me to experiment with/within my own creativity. The following version seems more true, clear, vivid and, certainly, more concentrated.  I am thankful.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
Student 2 focusses on the question and title of the poem &ldquo;Why I am not a painter&rdquo;.
In very interesting manner ideas of student 2 about how the poem is written are discussed. I really like what you think about the word &ldquo;rather&rdquo;, &ldquo;drink&rdquo;, &ldquo;go&rdquo; and later on your explanation about orange and the number 12.
The work of the painter and the poet are compared and both groups of artist belong to the New York school and they shared many ideas. Perhaps the classification into poet or painter is a bit artificial and comes from the public opinion. You show up that in neither oeuvre the title occurs. New York school principals are although mentioned with a focus on the form of the poem.

Simultaneously, the interpretation taken in the Kelly House video--that real notions of physical attraction, human interaction and sensuality with all its real-life complexities are objectified in this poem--is equally compelling (though it makes this a less moving, less rich poem). I suspect that the former might have been intentional and the latter unintentional on Pound's part. Nevertheless, Pound's later move to Vorticism with its heavy abstractions supports this interpretation.  ",2

Here is a guide for assessing and commenting on essay #1 (close reading of Dickinsonâ€™s â€œI taste a liquor never brewedâ€). Please answer, at least briefly, all five sets of questions. Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? In other words, does the essay quote and/or in other ways account for the actual words used by poet? We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? Once youâ€™ve noted and remarked on whether the essay discusses these things, comment on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay does so.Does the paper say something about how Dickinsonâ€™s dashes works? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay deals with the dashes? Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly it discusses how the poemâ€™s form interacts with its content. For most essays that deal with this topic, the discussion will describe the way in which the speakerâ€™s figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble.Does the way the poem is written account for â€“ or befit â€“ the â€œstoryâ€ being told about the speaker? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay handles this issue.Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the paper account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
This essay does much more than paraphrase the poem, carefully using information gathered from the poem to support the author's interpretation. In contrast to other essays that I have read on the topic, this essay gave me more insight and was more thought-provoking. It discusses the ""how"" of the poem - how Dickinson used punctuation and capitalization, for example, to convey images and feelings. Although the essay talks about other types of punctuation, it does not specifically discuss the use of dashes and the effect they have on the reader. The author discussed the stanzaic form and its relation to a pub ballad. Beyond this, it doesn't specifically address the drunken feeling that the reader is meant to experience through the poem.&nbsp;
The essay clearly describes a meta-poem with the intoxication of the poem's subject being Dickinson's creativity and the kind of naughtiness of the drunkard relating to the rule-breaking of the poem itself. It does not specifcially address the shifts in metaphor and why Dickinson moved from a human drunkard to insect or from inside a pub to outside in the flower bed. It does bring up and nicely support a spiritual component, relating the Landlord to the gods, for example. Overall, the essay was well-considered and provocative with the author's interpretation well-supported and interesting. Nice job.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
The author should, in the future, keep in mind that no one point in history has a monopoly on poetry. &nbsp;Pound probably would not have much liked this style, but a lot of people didn't like his style several decades earlier, and we'll come to some modern poets soon enough which are stranger still. &nbsp;Every genre/movement has it's exceptional practitioners, history usually filters out many of the ones who weren't so good. &nbsp;You probably won't find a truly bad imagist poet still published, but you can probably go to an open mic and hear countless terrible poets (and maybe a good one who will stick around).
Sorry, the essay began with a complaint of poetry, so I began with an apology. &nbsp;The essay offers the simple explanation at the end, that O'Hara likes to have lots of words and flexibility, and thus he is not a painter. &nbsp;Of the essays I've read, this seems to be the best guess at the central question.
I think that the author attempted to read&nbsp;too closely (a hard poem to do line by line, but I guess it's what Al asked for) and got overwhelmed, because the numbering of lines kind of trails off, and a lot is left out. &nbsp;I had not seen a good reading of ""I drink; we drink"" as merely a moment of friendship, I'm glad that this line got some attention.
Overall, I'd just replace the opening paragraph with some more insights into the actual poem, good essay.

You do a good job of pointing out the consistent use of metaphor throughout your paper, additionally comparing Dickinson's conceit to other poets you are familiar with (text to text). Your comments clearly identify the euphoria expressed by Dickinson and you quote liberally from the work to support your claims. I like your insight about the poet's increasing spirituality; I think you make a very good point here. You further build on this insight into the pagen ""rites, celestial desires and spiritual images"" by talking about her ""union with nature.""&nbsp;You chose to do a line by line analysis in which you reveal much of the thematic elements of the poem rather than focusing on the structural aspects.&nbsp;

7465,1347637254,"Putting a 'slant' on something, to my mind, refers pretty specifically to language and how we say things. A main question that this poem throws up for me is:

Can we ever say something without a slant?

Because words are, in a very real sense, the sum of our experiences concerning that word up until that point: Think of the different reactions to the word 'home', for example, that are experienced by, firstly, someone who is comfortable in their home (which they may take for granted), and then by someone who is exiled from their own country and people of birth...

I don't think this is what ED is getting at though. What I hear her saying (today, anyways!) is that direct experience qualifies language, and that the full breadth/understanding of truth is a gradual process by necessity given our human condition... even if we told the whole truth, would the listener/reader be in an experiential position to understand it?

This poem suggests that 'all the truth' can be expressed in words however... Which leads me to the question: What are those words!?

I agree with the view above; that truth, either in experience or words, is a construct... and yet some things appeal to people as more universally 'true' than others in terms of how they successfully capture certain realities about our human existence.

The very fact that everyone constructs their own truth can itself be said to represent a universal truth.

Also, in the real flow of things, is language and meaning in some way abstracted from 'reality', from the truth? Is to consider it so not imposing a un-holistic discrimination against what is 'real' and what is not? In order, for example, to write a poem, the poet must have a lot of words and their attendant, communally agreed meanings along with the poet's accompanying experiences which colour the meaning of those words and create associations in the poet's mind... to negate any aspect of that as 'abstract' surely takes away from what must be the very real process that led to the real thing that we see before us on the page: A poem is its words/meanings, and the poet's personal experiences of these, just like a cake in no small part exists due to the recipe and cooking instructions that went into its making at whatever stage.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
The condensing of the poem is thoroughly treated by the author of this essay, with a sound argument outlining details of how this distillation and simplification has been achieved. Indeed, some interesting suggestions as to the &nbsp;context of this image are suggested in the second paragraph, which would reay warrant greater discussion. How valid are these suggestions? What evidence supports them?&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The treatment of Version 1 is thorough and the author astutely details the ways in which the poem is more ""diffuse"" as well as some further suggestive and interesting thoughts on what is going on in the image presented to the reader.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
All together a thoughtful and fascinating essay which is well argued - I would be keen to hear more detail on some of the suggestions that are made but naturally this is a challenge within the confines of a short essay. In addition the informal and practical style in which it is written is highly refreshing - well done [REDACTED]!&nbsp;

I like your essay very much. There are some points in the rubric you didn't cover (such as the subjectivity of the speaker, or the prepositions), but you did a great job comparing the language of the first version and that of the second. I agree, Imagist poetry requires the reader to ""read in"" details that are not there (such as why the woman is crying), rather than trying to clarify everything. Paradoxically, the second version is much more clear than the first and you noticed that well. You noticed another paradox - that the second version follows more ""rules"" when it comes to form. You have made me see things in a different light and I am grateful for that.&nbsp;

First off, I gotta say that this is a really well-written poem! I definitely enjoyed reading it!
1. Yes, the essay talks about the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing. The writer also accounts for the meaning created by the juxtaposition between the original and the edited version of the poem he used.
2. The essay does not exactly go in depth into the writer's thoughts on the virtues and vices of this mode of writing, but he does talk about how the process of this experiment gave him a sense of letting go.
I think it's really interesting how the writer of this essay continued on to eliminate other aspects of the poem when he found that he was unsatisfied with the initial ""written-through"" version. Very insightful essay!

While this is a quaint interpretation of the poem, or imposition of one's own visceral response to the poem, and does to some degree engage superficially with the basic content, form is not touched on (capitalized key words, line/sentence/stanza breaks.. clearly denoted cultural allusions that can be researched with ease). I am not sure this is as close a reading as we have learned to do by this point in the class.
WHAT is the drinking metaphor you refer to? Drinking is an action and becoming drunk is a process but what is Emily talking about in addition to what is obvious. There is most often underlying meaning and shifting of meaning. Yes, the poem does point to some beautiful nature, but the nature you are referring to is also it's own metaphor.&nbsp;
The visuals you claim are associated with lines such as ""Inebriate of Air -- Am I"" is actually not particularly evocative of imagery, at least not as a isolated statement. Where is Emily (and where are we) according to the imagery she actually provides within the poem? Recall the ""geography of mind"" that is often present in Dickinson's work which was touched on a bit in the video discussions.
I could go on, but to be frank, you wrote a decent amount and still managed to make no insightful contribution to my (and other readers') understanding. Even the paraphrasing here is lazy. It is acceptable to pick and choose (to some degree) words and phrases that stand out for you, but whole swaths of interesting material are, for all intents and purposes, ignored.

The essay, which includes the mesostic which it reffers to&nbsp; makes a clear and interesting speculation about the relationship between the spine, the source text and the mesostic obtained. The author builds his arguments on his understanding of and relation to the source text.
The author finds that the whole mesostization process makes no sense because man will always try to get meaning even where it does not exist, provided that he is stimulated.

 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
Wow.. What a great poem... I am rather at a loss at how to evaluate it. And, tossing the guidelines found in the evaluation rubric, I must admit that I enjoyed enjoyed these Variations on the Lunch Poems and its delicious stanzas very much. It is packed with delightful, rolling-on-your tongue alliterations, so dear to my [REDACTED] ear (swiss mussy muss mustard...), and surprising insights into O'Hara's poem itself. That Goldberghad forsaken images for letters is a take is a reading that didn't occur to me, but I feel it is true. And hence the conclusion:&nbsp;Is the poem asking whether you can be a painter&nbsp;without being a poet or a poet without being a painter? Upon reading this, I experienced one of those 'aha' moments, and I am only too grateful to have been given the chance to read this remarkable submission. My only worry is that my evaluation didn't do it justice because it requires a close reading of itself... But anyway, great job!

Essay
There are several important part to the Imagist manifesto as we explore two variations of one poem called ""Young Woman at a Window"" by William Carlos Williams.
The first part of the manifesto directs the poet ""[t]o use the language of common speech, but to employ the exact word, not the nearly-exact, nor the merely decorative word.""
Some of the major changes in the two versions reside in the word choices. In version 1 the poem begins with ""while"" whereas in version 2 it begins with ""she sits"", so the poem moved from the notion of a temporary act of sitting to the definitive act of sitting. The version 1 poems also claims that the child has robbed her of something but when compared to the telling that the child only has his nose pressed to the glass in version 2 were are again moved from the notion of implication to that which he is doing, presented in such a way as to use exact wording to convey an idea.
The second part of the manifest claims ""We believe that the individuality of a poet may often be better expressed in free verse than in conventional forms. In poetry, a new cadence means a new idea.""
Both poems, as present above in the assignment follow a similar free verse convention and can, at first glance, appears exceedingly similar.
The third aspect of the manifesto calls for ""Absolute freedom in the choice of subject.""
The subject in both poems is a crying woman with a child on her lab. They both, however, seem to explore different things. In version 1, the theme is dominated by the idea that the child unknowingly and possibly unintentionally robbed this woman of something. One can assume it might be something like the freedoms afforded to one who is not committed to children, a lament on the changes of parenthood. In version 2 were are left with more ideas to ponder as the source of her tears. That the child has his nose pressed to the window seems to imply that there is something the child sees or is waiting to see. Ideas may form that the woman was lamenting a loss while the child was expecting to see that which the woman was crying about, possibly the father who had left or a child care provider who had quit and that the woman was saddened by this action while the child awaited the return unaware that it was in vain.
The forth aspect of the Imagist Manifesto calls for the poet ""To present an image. We are not a school of painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous. It is for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet, who seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art.""
When we consider the two poems, version 2 allows for the visual imagery to create the story as the reader begins to picture the ideas in the poem. In the poem presented as version 1, we are provided with sentiment, which clouds the visual representation of the poem with un-seeable notions of robbery and theft as being the reasons for the crying.
The manifesto ask the poet ""To produce a poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite.""
Similar to the ideas in the previous item of the manifest that was discussed, this calls for straight talk. The version 1 poem provides the read with blurred and indefinite ideas in how it reveals the child in the lap, as being the thief and cause for tears in the woman. The child in version 2 is minimally described except for the fact that it has its nose pressed against glass
Lastly, the manifesto calls for the poet to adhere to the idea ""that concentration is of the very essence of poetry.""
One can experiencedtwo distinct forms on mental interpretation. In the version 1 poem one may be left to pondering almost immediately the reason behind the child's thievery. It was the information and idea that was provided clearly and became a central focus of the poetic analysis. In version 2, if read separate from the version 1, it appears that there is merely a presentation of facts. This causes for a deeper concentration on the imagery provided and lends itself to thinking the poem more like a painting, to explore the poem as pieces of a puzzle to be concentrated upon and discerned.

Here is a guide for assessing and commenting on essay #1 (close reading of Dickinsonâ€™s â€œI taste a liquor never brewedâ€). Please answer, at least briefly, all five sets of questions. Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? In other words, does the essay quote and/or in other ways account for the actual words used by poet? We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? Once youâ€™ve noted and remarked on whether the essay discusses these things, comment on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay does so.Does the paper say something about how Dickinsonâ€™s dashes works? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay deals with the dashes? Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, signiicantly and/or interestingly it discusses how the poemâ€™s form interacts with its content. For most essays that deal with this topic, the discussion will describe the way in which the speakerâ€™s figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble.Does the way the poem is written account for â€“ or befit â€“ the â€œstoryâ€ being told about the speaker? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay handles this issue.Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the paper account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
The writer did not paraphrase the poem.&nbsp; However, I felt I was reading more of a biography of Emily - more then I really cared to know.&nbsp; A lot of time and thought was put in to the paper - much of it very interesting.&nbsp; Some differences of interpretation are enevitable as in the final stanza.&nbsp; My feel was Emily was saying thatnot a chance in hell that Seraphs or Saints would thus behave as there was no way she was giving up her adiction to the nectar of life.
&nbsp;
Saw no mention of use of dashes.
&nbsp;
Stanzaic for was mentioned only in passing.&nbsp; No real review of the method or use of it.
&nbsp;
ED's use of the Stanziac form was I believe, perfect for the short story being told.&nbsp; Brief, punchy lines&nbsp; - no wasted verbiage really exciting reading.&nbsp; I don't think the author of the essay covered that.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Original poem:
There they go marching all in step so gay!Smooth-cheeked and golden, food for shells and guns.Blithely they go as to a wedding day,The mothers' sons.
The drab street stares to see them row on rowOn the high tram-tops, singing like the lark.Too careless-gay for courage, singing they goInto the dark.
With tin whistles, mouth-organs, any noise,They pipe the way to glory and the grave;Foolish and young, the gay and golden boysLove cannot save.
High heart! High courage! The poor girls they kissedRun with them: they shall kiss no more, alas!Out of the mist they stepped-into the mistSinging they pass.
&nbsp;
This poem centres around young men joining the army and being sent off to war. Glancing over it, you can clearly see how the adjectives help to form the poem and emphasise the depth. As a reader, there is an overall feeling of sadness to this poem, for example ""food for shells and guns"" suggests that the men are bait and will be killed in battle, even though the men, the subject of it, seem happy. However there is a stark contrast between the men's excitement at going off - they are full of courage and believe the propoganda that they will return - and the reality that they may die.
&nbsp;
Keeping the&nbsp;Bernadette Mayer Experiment in mind, I will now remove all the adjectives from the poem and talk about the changes:
&nbsp;
There they go marching all in step so gay!Smooth-cheeked and golden, food for shells and guns.Blithely they go as to a wedding day,The mothers' sons.
The drab street stares to see them row on rowOn the high tram-tops, singing like the lark.Too careless-gay for courage, singing they goInto the dark.
With tin whistles, mouth-organs, any noise,They pipe the way to glory and the grave;Foolish and young, the gay and golden boysLove cannot save.
High heart! High courage! The poor girls they kissedRun with them: they shall kiss no more, alas!Out of the mist they stepped - into the mistSinging they pass.
&nbsp;
By removing the adjectives, a lot of the hopefulness of the poem gets taken away. The boys are no longer ""smooth cheeked and golden"", but simply ""food for shells and guns"". They aren't going ""blithely"" but just going; maybe this way they are in fact worried about what lies ahead and not as optimistic. The removal of ""mothers'"" suggests that these young men don't belong to anybody, and it adds to the feeling of sadness, while also emphasising how so many men went off to war.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The line ""singing like the lark"" hints at freedom. Are the boys really free because they have the opportunity to leave home and fight for their country, or would limitation actually be better, as it would keep them safe?&nbsp;
&nbsp;
There is also something to be said about how removing these words changes the structure of the poem. The original structure has an alternate line rhyming scheme and a linear syllable scheme. This gives the feeling of marching, much like the boys are marching off. However when the words are taken out, these schemes are no longer present and it could be said that this echoes the&nbsp;unpredictability of what they are embarking on.

SHOOT ME got you there. Irony. 

Your personal story aspect of the essay is amusing. You went from ""I flinch at the task. It feels so seedy, like skulking near a filthy pawn shop with a thieved heirloom.""

To

""I am immediately embarrassed to find Emily Dickinson in my house, sitting beside me, patiently explaining the pronouns that encompass us; the master and his gun, the poet and her tasks, the poet and her world, the reader and the writer. I find myself in the most intimate of conversations with the original poet, apologetically and tentatively enquiring whether she may have meant me too.""

To

""May they live long, may the act of poetry writing survive, and may other sceptics be converted.""

All of this is strong commentary on the possibilities of chance poetry and the mesostic form.

I especially like:

""No-one will know."" Now we do.

Well done. Good conversion.

Essay
Manifesto 1. To use the language of common speech, but to employ the exact word, not the nearly-exact, nor the merely decorative word.
Version 2 of ""Young woman at a window"" is precise. &nbsp;It snapshots a moment of time and there is nothing very referential about it. &nbsp;It describes in crystal clear tones the shape and outline of a scene. &nbsp;In Ver. 1, there is a kind of ambiguity; a hinting at rather than incising out. &nbsp;Version 2 is like a lino cut of shapes. &nbsp;The woman; the tears; the child on her lap; nose against a window pane. &nbsp;We don't need to read anything more into this vignette. &nbsp;It is what it is. &nbsp;Ver. 1 however, reads like a tome of nuances. There is a cascade of story, particularly embedded in the lines ""who robs her."" &nbsp;How intruiging! &nbsp;Ver 2 has none of ""that"" - it delineates in an almost matter-of-fact way the outline rather than emeshing itself in subterranean twists.&nbsp;
Manifesto 2. We believe that the individuality of a poet may often be better expressed in free verse than in conventional forms. In poetry, a new cadence means a new idea.
Ver 1 feels more like a ""traditional"" poem in the sense that it references nuances and details that evoke rather than explain. &nbsp;Ver 2 seems quite prosaic and even the sound of it, read aloud, is cadenced in sharp, critiqued bursts of sound. &nbsp;This version appears to free WCW to take the stance of an austere overseer. &nbsp;Ver 1 encapsulates him inside the story of the poem - but he's more diffuse and sublimated as the characters in the story tend to take over. &nbsp;Ver 2 provides him with the stronger voice as the characters in the poem are less characters than shapes to be drawn.&nbsp;
Manifesto 3. Absolute freedom in the choice of subject.&nbsp;
Ver 2 does not free the image from itself. &nbsp;It does however free the reader to see the image in as much clarity as they choose. &nbsp;""Pressed to the glass"" - this phrasing provides a kind of unambiguous meme. &nbsp;It's almost obvious - there's not much obtuse or unclear about it. &nbsp;The thing is ""pressed"" against ""the glass"" - the glass is a window, a drinking vessel, a mirror, a toy. &nbsp;We do not know and it does not matter. &nbsp;The choice in the subject is the pressing, not the glass itself.
Manifesto 4. To present an image. We are not a school of painters, but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous. It is for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet, who seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art.&nbsp;Ver 2 does appear more painterly of the two versions. &nbsp;Ver 1 is novel'esque. &nbsp;It imbues the characters with souls and elusive qualities surreptitiously captured wholelistically throughout the telling.&nbsp;Ver 2 however draws us to the shape of the scene as a whole. &nbsp;It squares off the language, rendering it down to the simplest of terms.&nbsp;Manifesto 5. To produce a poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor indefinite.
Ver 2 has an edginess to it that Ver 1 just doesn't have. &nbsp;There are less syllables (I think), and it's curt in its tonal quality. &nbsp;It is definitely clearer than Ver 1 in that the words are so prosaic and everyday. &nbsp;The language flows in different tonal qualities despite there being only ever two or three words per row. &nbsp;Somehow, ""She sits with tears on her cheek"" reads entirely differently than ""While she sits there."" &nbsp;""While she sits there"" comes across as evocative of a memory, a theme, an embellishment in the story. &nbsp;""She sits"" is entirely what it is. A clear thing that IS and cannot be otherwise.
6. Finally, most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence of poetry.Ver 2 is the ""condensary"". &nbsp;It shifts nothing to the subjective gaze but everything to the external observational viewpoint. &nbsp;It pulls everything from around the hard clean lines of its form into a clarity of purpose that isn't out to teach, sway, cajol, lure, enmesh or intertwine. &nbsp;Ver 2 states emphatically and with a resolute force of will on the part of WCW that it feels quite intensive - almost hard. &nbsp;Vers 2 is definitively the imagist version of this poem. &nbsp;

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
The first stanza introduces a metaphor which will give the tone to the whole poem. The first line demonstrates that the speaker experiences a kind of ecstatic pleasure comparable to alcoholic beverage intoxication, but that liquor has never been brewed, or rather, it is not effectively a drink. In fact, it is served in a &ldquo;tankard craved in pearl&rdquo;, which highlights the preciousness or rarity of her experience. It is important to notice that the metaphor conveys experience which would otherwise be difficult to explain.
From this point on, it is possible to guess that the speaker&rsquo;s experience transcends the physical world and suggests the unity between the self and the surrounding nature. The metaphor of drunkenness stands for her intoxication with the beauty of nature.
The Vats upon the Rhine mentioned in the following lines possibly barrels containing a type of vine of great value and exquisite taste. Even so, they would never be able to produce such a kind of experience.
The speaker is a special &ldquo;drunkard&rdquo;, for she is &ldquo;inebriated of air&rdquo;, drunk on &ldquo;dew&rdquo;, reeling from &ldquo;inns of Molten Blue&rdquo;, that is, from a sky which seems to be fluid and it effectively fills her whole being up, as if it were a tavern from which the liquor flowed uninterruptedly. Being in such a state, she staggers through the endless summer days.
There are some formal aspects which sound relevant, like the poet&rsquo;s choice of formal words to refer to her special kind of addiction: inebriate, debauchee. The choice seems to emphasize the spiritual nature of her intoxication.
The metaphor shifts when she likens herself to bees and butterflies, which imbibe the nectar from flowers, but differently from bees, which have to leave the closing flower, not to be trapped, and butterflies, which give up gathering nectar from flowers after having taken their &ldquo;drams&rdquo;( a small drink of liquor), the speaker will be able to continue drinking from nature spiritual liquor endlessly.The last stanza begins with the word &ldquo;Till&rdquo; indicating that it refers to the previous line, to the length of her drinking: until seraphs, the highest order of angels, shake their &ldquo;snowy Hats&rdquo; and saints hurry to &ldquo;the windows of Heaven&rdquo; to watch her, a little Tippler, &ldquo;Leaning against the &ndash; Sun &ndash;&ldquo;.
Alliteration in the line &ldquo;Till seraphs swing their snowy hats&rdquo; suggests a wind blowing the clouds, perhaps to observe clearly that &ldquo;little Tippler&rdquo;, who is drunk with summer's splendor.
The word &ldquo;Tippler&rdquo; seems to have a double meaning: it might refer either to a spiritual drunkard, who recognizes her smallness before the vastness of nature, or to a flying tippler, a kind of pigeon, &mdash;a possible metaphor for the soul in its connection to Paradise. This interpretation may find support in the Transcendentalist idea that finding God depended on neither orthodox creedalism nor the sensible exercise of virtue, but on one's inner striving toward spiritual communion with the divine spirit, which is immanent in nature. Divinity is self-contained, internalized in every being.
Obviously the dash before the word &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; sounds provocative, as if the speaker were providing a kind of suspense regarding the thing against which the Tippler would be leant. The Sun&rsquo;s position suggests the end of a day, that is, sunset. Thus, there is a possibility that the poem be a summary of the activities of a whole day.
On the other hand, there is another dash after the word &ldquo;Sun&rdquo;, whose connection with the heavenly imagery of the last stanza suggests that she would never stop drinking that spiritual nectar; her drinking would be eternal. The creative insight and interpretation of the poet&rsquo;s inner voices would last forever through her words. Thus, the final dash is a pause, but not a period, not an end.

To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
The ""How"" of the Poem: &nbsp;This essay writer did, in my view, an excellent job in paraphrasing the poem and seems very comfortable in doing it. &nbsp;He/she provides rich detail that illuminate the sparse verse, and tells the story that Dickinson may be attempting to tell. &nbsp;She does relate the poem to Dickinson's own life (biographical fallacy?), but does not explain why such a prim and proper Amherst woman would be reeling in drunkenness. &nbsp;This is unanswered, except to perhaps suggest that she is feeling intoxicated, but only in her imagination. I wonder if Dickinson ever really personally experienced drunkenness; else, how could she describe it?
Dashes: The essay-writer mentions ""the only non-dash punctuation in the whole piece"" - the exclamation point. &nbsp;She does not attribute any significance to that beyond pointing it out.
Form: The essay writer does mention meter, syllables and stanzas but, again, does not assign significance to them.
Story: &nbsp;The essay writer handles the story in a very entertaining way; I found the essay just as enjoyable as the poem, and perhaps even more so. &nbsp;I didn't have to dig as hard! He/she seems content not to pull all of the pieces together--bees, inns, seraphims, etc.--and perhaps that is how it should be. &nbsp;
Shift in Metaphor/Conceit: &nbsp;The essay writer seems to observe that the second stanza ""establishes the metaphor of the liquor of life,"" but does not explain that relationship very fully. &nbsp;There is perhaps a tiny leap of faith made by the essay writer in equating form with literary meaning. &nbsp;But I thouroughly enjoyed being a witness as he/she explored it. &nbsp;A wonderful essay.

This essay is delightful. &nbsp;Linking the mesostics algorithm to Orwell is a thought provoking and ulitmately satisfactory idea. &nbsp;Both Cage and Orwell explored the eradication of ego, but to Cage it was a liberating experience and to Orwell, it was, well, Orwellian. &nbsp;The contrast between the versificator and Cage, and the beauty of the versificator-generated song, opens up new ways to think about chance. &nbsp;
The author's comment that he or she is trying not to analyze how closely the mesostics capture the sprit of Orwell's characters is intriguing. &nbsp;Why is that something to be avoided? &nbsp;I am not saying that instinct is right or wrong, and I would love to be able to discuss with the author if any line of inquiry into mesostics is better than any other. &nbsp;
The author's comments on the coldness of the opening lines of the mesostics is a good close reading. &nbsp;It brings to mind the source used. &nbsp;
Now I have to go back and re-read 1984 to see what Orwell's view of chance poetry is, and whether he gives any examples in the book. &nbsp;Thank you for making another piece of literature so urgent!

77014,1352610897,"I have really enjoyed following this thread. For me, and it sounds like for others, there came a point when I needed to define my stance towards the experience of the course as much as the poetry that was its nominal subject. How much time and effort could I devote to metapedagogical analysis? This moment of judgment happened around â€œThis is Just to Sayâ€ in week 3. I posted the note below in a discussion forum on that poem, and it has remained a useful perspective as the poems have gotten harder to â€œglimpseâ€ ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED]'s term for that evanescent connection to a something in a poem) and the messages from the seminar room became more lyric.

I am grateful to Prof. [REDACTED] and his colleagues for opening up their faith in the power of Modernist poetry to enrich peopleâ€™s lives for our examination. But skepticism, as we hear in this thread, is a good place to start.

I assume that the poems that we are reading form the foundational structure of that faith. This course asks only that we invest some time and effort (no money yet!) to examine the architecture of that foundation. Sometimes, I suppose, in digging into these poems we will feel a resonance with our own experience that is reassuring or comforting or fortifying, and we will sing along with the choir. For me that has happened with â€œIn a Station of the Metroâ€, â€œIt isnâ€™t for Wantâ€, and â€œThis is Just to Sayâ€. Sometimes we will see only a reliquary that can be hidden away in a jeweled box and worshiped by the faithful.

You have done a good job of pulling this poem apart, looking at the various pieces and laying out what they might mean in terms of drinking.&nbsp; Your essay stays quite close to the literal meaning, rather than the symbolic meaning, of the poem.&nbsp; You have also done well with showing the porgression of the poem through stages of drunkenness.&nbsp; There is a missing dimension, I think -- namely What is the meaning of the drunkenness?&nbsp; What does the drunkenness stand for?&nbsp; You suggest some possibilities in your comments on the line ""I shall but drink the more.""&nbsp; Your essay would be strengthened by following that theme through the rest of the poem to see how it developed.&nbsp; You handle the shift Dickenson makes between the first two stanzas and the last two stanzas.&nbsp; But you could make your essay stronger if you commented on Dickenson's use of dashes.&nbsp; (I know.&nbsp; I didn't do this either.&nbsp; Too much going on in the words for me to think of that.)

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
This essay touches on the question of subjectivity even if it is more focused on a technical examination of language. It moves to examine the use of more specific language and the removal of interpretative ambiguity, but not more etchincal aspects like the use of prepositions. Laudably, the essay also acknowledges that both poems are imagist.&nbsp;

Essay
What is Imagism and how did it come to be? Imagism officially began in the year 1912 when Ezra Pound sent one of Hilda Doolittle's poem to Harriet Monroe, signed and marked with ""H.D. Imagism"". Imagism describes a major movement in poetry that favors vivid imagery and clear, sharp language and expressions. A poem must adhere to six rules in order for it to be considered an imagism. The Imagist Manifesto states that an imagist poem (1) does not use any word that does not contribute whatsoever to the whole presentation, (2) it is presented and expressed in free verse, (3) it offers a freedom in terms of subject, (4) it presents a vivid image through its choice of words, (5) it produces a clear and hard element in whole, and lastly, (6) it concentrates on one subject or theme. It is said that William Carlos Williams wrote Young Woman at a Window under the influence of imagism, however, the different versions create a conflict in which the second version is more imagist than the first.
William Carlos Williams expresses both versions of Young Woman at a Window in a free verse manner. He does not follow any rhyme scheme or any stanzaic form. William Carlos Williams also provides absolute freedom regarding the choice of subject in both versions. He leaves room for open discussion. In addition, Williams presents an image in both versions. He renders particulars rather than dealing with vague generalities. For example, in version 2, we can clearly visualize the child's foggy breath against the window as he presses his nose to the glass. Williams uses direct treatment of the image itself.&nbsp;So far, we have proved that both versions are perhaps imagism through its use of three out of six rules in the manifesto. However, where does that leave the other three?
From the very first look at version 2, we can already see how it uses the language of common speech. Williams added unnecessary words to version 1, such as while (line 1), there (2), and little (7), that when taken out, will not change the meaning of the poem. Williams also makes the story more vague in version 1 by adding the excerpt, ""...the little child who robs her know nothing of his theft..."" (7-10), leaving room for questions and vagueness, thus, breaking rule #5. Version 2 produces an element that is hard and clear. Williams is straight to the point in this version rather than approaching poetry's traditional way of making their readers dig dip for the meaning. In addition, version 2 better concentrates on the subject, the woman and her child. It is also more condensed, allowing its readers to focus solely on what the woman and the child is doing. William Carlos Williams uses condensery in version 2 which is what a poet should do according to Lorine Niedecker&rsquo;s poem, Poet's work.
It is clear to see that version 2 adhered to all six rules in the Imagist manifesto. Although the first version provides more information and has more to the story, version 2's condensed and straightforward nature definitely makes is more imagist than the first.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
This is a good essay that discusses some points that I have personally missed in my close reading of the poem. Thanks to this essay which discusses the writer's views on the poem point-by-point, I also have a better understanding of O'Hara's poem.&nbsp;
The writer managed to find the irony in the poem and discussed the poem in detail. Good job.

This essay definitely does more than paraphrase the poem- explains the stanzas, poetic devices and the choice of words. It has a unique way of dealing with the punctuation. It explains the form of the poem from the get-go and gets very detailed about the form of the poem. (As a novice, I do not think of myself as qualified to evaluate this part)
The writer seems to be following the poet's use of dashes quite literally in their close reading of the work. In my view, this is done effectively although the dashes are not mentioned, but at the beginning the form of the poem is explained clearly.
The author clearly explains the stanzaic form and this is done quite effectively.
the story of the poem is very well explained and the paper follows the shift in metaphor and does this very well and in great detail.

60989,1350916532,"Does the impersonal ""one"" indicate the mechanical way in which we go about our daily lives when we grieve?

Although the title says, ""A Step Away From Them,"" the speaker is actually moving away from the ""my"" and ""I"" in the beginning of the poem closer to ""A Negro,"" ""A blonde,"" ""A lady"" and then on to ""several Puerto Ricans."" It is right after that, at the moment the speaker mentions how the Puerto Ricans makes the avenue ""beautiful and warm"" that he lists his friend's deaths: 

""First / Bunny died, then John Latouche, /then Jackson Pollock.""

Then the speaker asks: ""But is the earth as full as life was full, of them?""

It is as if he is feeling their absence more acutely in that warm and lively avenue, and his actions become mechanical: ""And one has eaten and one walks."" He has stepped outside of himself almost, and stepped away from those around him in the avenue to speak privately to his sorrow, but then pulls himself back to the rich life surrounding him, and to what remains important and what endures: 

""My heart is in my / pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.""

I like what you&rsquo;ve done here. It seems a very bold choice to take a poem that is a list of instructions (and thus necessarily depends on action) and then excise its verbs. What is, indeed, interestingly remarkable about your result is that one can still sort of discern the process.
What is frustrating about your essay is that I want more. I&rsquo;d like to see even more of the analysis you do so well (maybe a close reading of a couple of lines, like &ldquo;the poem you&rdquo; or &ldquo;as long as you your poem&rdquo;) and an exploration of what you see as the value of an exercise like this.

14156,1348309936,"My knowledge of Greek philosophy is quite limited, but all the time during the discussion of the difference between Dickinson and Whitman there was at the back of my mind a feeling of having been in a similar tension zone before. Now I believe to have found where I have encountered it before: Isnâ€™t Plato a philosopher of ideas and Aristotle more one of the appreciation of the multitude of experiences, which he liked to enumerate in catalogues? Isnâ€™t that something of a parallel to our two poets here? And doesnâ€™t Dickinsonâ€˜s habit of capitalization somehow even stress her adherence to ideas? Also, she talks about a â€žTruthâ€œ she wants to tell, but she has to tell it slant, because, just as in Platoâ€™s Allegory of the Cave, we canâ€™t bear to know Truth in an unfiltered way (which would make Dickinson herself the Romantic poet, the intermediator between Truth and us, all eyeball, who can take it and filter it for us.) If any of you is knowledgeable about Greek philosophy, please tell me if you agree to this parallel.

It seems reasonable to ask of writers doing this assignment if they have something to say about this kind of ""writing through"" a previous text, or about aleatory or ""unoriginal"" poetry generally. Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing? If the short essay interpretation of the experiment does not address either of the issues identified above, base your peer review on any issues or questions that seem appropriate to the essay.
Sorry in this little essay there no much to say abot the poem but nevertheless it brightly shows the relationships betwen original source text, stem or spine work (here the word SLANT) and resulting mesostic.&nbsp;
The essay in a very unique gives an explanation of the meanining of Emily Dickinson'es poem ""Tell all the truth"" which is not about approaching blind people but it presents something diametrically opposite.&nbsp;
Taking into account the staight vertical wich is for ordinary people and a slanted vertical for blind people who are in need of eased explanation.&nbsp;
This essay is very well done.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?

This essay notes well the difference in condensation, grammar, and preposition usages between the two poems. It also mentions the difference in implication of who or what the subject is. However, there is no mention of tradition. Overall, a well done analysis.

The essay was able to note the condensation of the poem by pointing out the disappearance of the narrative in the second poem. &nbsp;It gave a good description of the second poem as blocks of words stacked upon another because that's really how it reads like when the emotional thread is removed. &nbsp;It was also observant on the part of the essayist to note the change of cadence in the first poem. &nbsp;Noting the order of description on the second poem was also a good observation as that's how the eye will move when viewing an image.

1. does not describe condensation of V.2 compared to V.1
2. Does discuss the use of ""while"" in setting up the motion in V.1, and says it causes the image to not be static like V.2. &nbsp;Also discusses the use of ""theft"" and says that an attempt at describing an emotion cannot really use an exact word, which is in respect to the Imagist Manifesto.
3. no discussion of prepositions.
4. no discussion of the subjectivity of the speaker.
5. does not dicuss symbolism such as ""madona and child"", but the title is ""two portraits of mom and child""
Overall, this was a very short essay, and it is not my understanding if the writer is of a different mother language.
The general idea about that the first is an emotional description and is not static and that the second is static is the general interperetation of the Imagist mode, I believe.
writer could learn from the rubric in which we are supposed to comment on as a guide for future poem interperetation.

Not all the Vats upon the Rhine Yield such an Alcohol!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could she be referring to German poetry? Music? Literature? as well?
I think that&rsquo;s why the word Sun is set apart by two dashes. The dashes emphasize the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why use the dashes? In other words why is this level of emphasis necessary. What about other punctuation and dashes in the poem?
&nbsp;
I liked the opening of your essay and commenting on the rhyme and songs.&nbsp; What is the rhyme scheme? Why use that rhyme?
Perhaps the liquor is the art of poetry as in I Dwell in Possibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good. I would suggest exploring that more including other references in the poem as you did with: If the liquor is the art of poetry, it could be that it is this art that keeps her young and alive. Maybe she is telling us that poetry in general can keep us alive and heartened.
I think you are correct. That is what she is telling us.
Good pickup on the foxglove! I am certain that she did not choose a flower accidentally but it was a purposeful choice and you hit it on the head! (If one can hit a flower that way!)
She&rsquo;s so engulfed in summer/youth that she&rsquo;s leaning directly against its source.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is that source?&nbsp;
I enjoyed your essay; in some cases you did what I did and that was to spend most of the time paraphrasing rather than breaking it down/apart. In my case it was because I am not familiar with close readings and metapoetry so I defaulted to my familiar style!&nbsp;
I liked very much how you tackled the use of language in the poem.&nbsp; Enjoyed it very much and learned at the same time!!!

I thought of it only as a man made device to keep something straight and ""true"", on a set course if you will, unchanging in its path and usually on the same path over and over again.

I looked at the splinter as the beginning of destruction.  The first splinter swirling off an old wheel or other mechanical device is its first sign of age or wear and a good indication that it will soon be useless or discarded.

The difficulty in putting flood waters back expresses to me the idea of unlearning or unknowing something.  Like trying to convince myself that there really is a Santa Claus or that the world is flat.

After reading it and before listening to the closed reading I thought she was making a social statement or an internal observation of how her own social views were changing/had changed.  Given the time she lived in and her proximity I theorized she had been influenced by Emerson or Thoreau. ",2
15468,1348458001,"It is true that grandfather is only advising. Perhaps this is a time and place where that is all that he thinks he needs to do, and that to insist would be unseemly and even reveal insecurity on his part. If he advises, she will naturally follow his advice. There is a cultural assumption in his advice. She is a woman and this is a capitalist society, perhaps with a Puritanical work ethic at that time. In this situation, grandfatherâ€™s advice follows the cultural norms that no decent person would contradict. It is almost a ritual for him to give this advice to his granddaughter and he perhaps does it without even seriously considering it.

This is the kind of advice that many women have been given for a long time. Even many men are given that message of learning a trade that will pay well, pay being a widely accepted measure of a jobâ€™s worth in a capitalist society. And for many people, a jobâ€™s worth is a lifeâ€™s worth. How many people pick a college major because they think it will be easier to find a well-paying job upon graduation? How many liberal arts majors are told that their major is risky, or even of questionable value?

I do not think grandfather is being malicious or consciously sexist or materialist, but I certainly would not call his advice â€œprogressiveâ€. He reflects his time and place. He does not question the norms and hopes his granddaughter does not either.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
On reading &ldquo;I taste a liquor never brewed&rdquo; by Emily Dickinson, the speaker begins with a warning that we are going off into the imaginary, not real &hellip;&rsquo;a liquor never brewed&rsquo; and stops us with a dash &ndash; pause and think about this before proceeding.
The poem is structured in four stanzas of four lines each, a medium short poem with meter 8686 and rhymes at the even number lines, XAXA. So it seems light, a little sing-song, pleasant and happy, telling a story. She uses capital letters where they are not ordinarily placed, to tell us that these are important, perhaps powerful and beautiful words&hellip;. Tankard (not a mere glass) &hellip;Pearl (beautiful and valuable) &hellip; Alcohol (a very strong kind, indeed finer than the excellent wines of the Rhine).
In the second stanza, she becomes drunk (Inebriate &ndash; am I) on air and Dew (refreshing and gentle). Could &ldquo;Debauchee of Dew&rdquo; be a little play on &lsquo;do&rsquo; or &lsquo;doing&rsquo;... to be morally led astray, indulging ones appetite for sensual pleasures? &rdquo; Reeling (like a staggering drunk) thro&rsquo; endless summer days &ldquo; (it&rsquo;s warm and pleasant). &ldquo;From inns of Molten Blue&rdquo;&hellip;like a traveler from an inn, flying through intensely and liquid blue skies. Then a dash, - let&rsquo;s pause a short second and catch our breath after all that reeling and flying.
In the third stanza she changes metaphors to things of Nature&hellip; a bee drunk on sweet honey, turned out of Foxglove&rsquo;s door (Digitalis,a drug for the heart) and butterflies have had enough of their tiny &lsquo;drams&rsquo; ( a unit of weight from &lsquo;drachma&rsquo;, an ancient Greek silver coin, precious). But she is defiant, she is not done and will only drink some more!
In the final stanza, she implies that she will keep on drinking until Heaven&rsquo;s highest angels, &ldquo;Seraphs&rdquo;, behaving like children &ldquo;swing their snowy hats&rdquo; (hats =halos &ndash; a ring of light that shines through ice crystals, symbolizing innocence or virtue). And even the &ldquo;Saints&rdquo; (the adults?) run to the windows (imaginary windows in Heaven or windows to the soul?) to see what? &ldquo;See the little Tippler (her, the drunk, but tippler is a kinder, softer word than drunk &ndash; will the Saints think of her as just a naughty little girl?) Leaning against the &ndash; (dash, pause &ndash; gasp) Sun! (surprise!) How happy! To lean on it you must be bigger that the Sun &ndash; is it low on the horizon, near sunset? If you can lean on the Sun you can do anything! To lean is to deviate from upright, also to lean on to depend upon for encouragement. The sun rises and sets every day, reliable, steady, warm and bright.
So ends her glorious day, high on air and dew and life! Where Whitman, too, describes the glory of Nature, he throws it open demanding us to see. Dickinson takes it all into her very being, possessing the world in her drunkenness, she tells us how it feels, in her own way. Life is good.
I would very much like to drink in the world with Emily&hellip; but that will also be &ldquo;a liquor never tasted&rdquo; indeed. But I can still imagine ....

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
At first I thought the &lsquo;liquor never brewed&rsquo; could be a metaphor for sunlight or the summer air or nature in general. I took &lsquo;Tankards scooped in Pearl&rsquo;, to mean that the sunlight or air doesn&rsquo;t come in richly ornamented vessels, but then I realised that alcohol isn&rsquo;t actually &lsquo;brewed&rsquo; in tankards, plus the capitals indicated that this was something significant in the poem. I then thought the &lsquo;Tankards scooped in Pearl&rsquo;, could be the sky, with the &lsquo;pearl&rsquo; being clouds. This sunlight or air is more intoxicating than the finest alcohol, &lsquo;not all the Vats upon the Rhine/ Yield such an Alcohol&rsquo;, the Rhine presumably being known for its fine alcohol at this period. The &lsquo;I&rsquo; of the poem is intoxicated by the very air, &lsquo;Inebriate of Air&rsquo; and &lsquo;debauchee&rsquo;, made unrestrained and self-indulgent by &lsquo;dew&rsquo;. Here I think as in so many of her poems Dickinson is using these metaphors to dual purpose, exaggerating to poke fun at herself, self-mocking, but also making the point that one doesn&rsquo;t need to be drunk on alcohol to have an intoxicating and exuberant appreciation of the world around you and the simple pleasures of nature. &lsquo;Reeling&rsquo; adds to this excitable, overcome exaggeration. She is not shut up in &lsquo;inns&rsquo; which although they serve alcohol are usually quite dark and shady compared to bright sunlight, instead the sky is her &lsquo;inn&rsquo;, &lsquo;inns of Molten Blue&rsquo;. The &lsquo;Molten&rsquo; emphasises the heat of the summer sky and the contrast of a shady traditional inn. Both &lsquo;Molten&rsquo; and &lsquo;Blue&rsquo; start with capitals to emphasise her preference for their heat and colour over the darker, cooler inn.
She intonates she is insatiable for sunlight, in that she will still want more when the bee and the butterflies have had their fill, the bee is turned out by the &lsquo;Landlord&rsquo; presumably for being too drunk, &lsquo;drunken Bee&rsquo;, and the butterflies &lsquo;Renounce their dram&rsquo;, have had as much as they can handle. Things are so much affected by this sunlight that the bee, usually portrayed as industrious, is here &lsquo;drunken&rsquo;.
She says even angels and saints will be excited by her intoxication with the sunlight, &lsquo;Seraphs swing their snowy Hats --/ And Saints -- to windows run --/ To see the little Tippler/ Leaning against the -- Sun &ndash;&lsquo; Angels swinging their hats and saints running to windows is reminiscent of them watching a parade passing by, a further exaggeration, since all there is to be seen is one &lsquo;Tippler&rsquo;, again a metaphor for being drunk, &lsquo;Leaning against the &ndash; sun&rsquo; is reminiscent of a drunk leaning against a lamp-post or wall, unable to stand upright, again a joke since by being teetotal instead of actually drunk, she is being upstanding or upright in the community&rsquo;s eyes. So this poem could be taken too as a temperance poem, saying you don&rsquo;t need to get drunk with alcohol to be happy or excited.
It also occurred to me that the &lsquo;inns of molten blue&rsquo; could be the &lsquo;foxgloves&rsquo; themselves, as in a field of flowers, reminiscent of Wordsworth&rsquo;s daffodils. Then the air she is &lsquo;inebriated&rsquo; with could be the perfume of the flowers. The &lsquo;dew&rsquo; could be the actual dew on the flowers and this reading is particularly backed up by the third stanza, when the metaphor for the bees turned out of the inn and butterflies renouncing their drams would be even more strongly knit if the &lsquo;inns&rsquo; were the foxgloves themselves. The &lsquo;tankards&rsquo; in the first stanza would be the cups of the flowers and the &lsquo;pearl&rsquo; the dew on the flowers.
The dashes seem to echo the staggering or reeling of a drunken inebriate.
The dash before the last word &lsquo;sun&rsquo; may emphasise that the poem is about the sun itself. &lsquo;Tippler&rsquo; could mean one&rsquo;s head tipped up to the sun to drink it in. Although then the bees being turned out and butterflies filled would seem to be a metaphor for the sun going down; and she couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;drink the more&rsquo; if the sun goes down.
As with most of Dickinson&rsquo;s poems, this poem is open to several interpretations. We may never know exactly what she meant but we can be enriched by our diligent search for meaning.

We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""?

If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay deals with the dashes? Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly it discusses how the poemâ€™s form interacts with its content. For most essays that deal with this topic, the discussion will describe the way in which the speakerâ€™s figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble.Does the way the poem is written account for â€“ or befit â€“ the â€œstoryâ€ being told about the speaker? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay handles this issue.Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the paper account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
The writer of this essay enthusiastically addressed issues of metaphor and intersubjectivity. &nbsp;The interpretation around the word ""Landlord"" was interesting as i spoke about the concept of ownership and who owns the poem, etc. She also addressed the meaning of Dickinson's use of quotation marks to imply another sense of the meaning,
While the writer did not address the dashes or stanzaic form, or specifically the shift in metapor, his or her own writing flitted about as an effective echoing of the poet's work.

I experience the imaginable which hasn't yet occurred
And the imaginable was Fine
And all the people who imagine today
Their imaginations pale by Mine.

Absorbed, drunk, in the atmosphere and breadth of my dream
fully embraced, in every carnal moist detail
Reeling, cartwheeling, pinballing through my middle years
under the temple of My revered sky.

When nature catches up with me
And tells me Time soon be no more
And hipsters park their fixie bikes

And ghosts, look out to see my song
To see my Jersey Wilde-ish display
coming to a close.

4742,1347416922,"I understood the poem rather differently from most of what I read and definitely from the video. I think the idea of kindness has not been given the weight it deserves.

1. One of the TAs mentioned that Emily was a woman and was forced to talk in a round-about way. That makes her look like a victim, trying to sneak in a little truth behind obfuscation. And I just can't see her do that; it doesn't fit with the rest of the poem, especially not the first four words.

I do instead think that she is pointing out a strength of women over men (generally of course), namely that kindness is very important in any interaction. One does not slant the truth to hide. And (contrary to [REDACTED]) I don't believe that talking about all related things and not about the cup, or talking about ancient myths is a kindness because it hides the truth too much.

2. The kindness we can give to others is to talk to them in a way they can understand it. I don't mean this in any paternalistic or patronizing way, but in a way that explores and respects the other. And withing this framework one is honest and straightforward. 

I never lied to my kids, but I did try to respond to what they wanted to know. I ""slanted"" the truth to their question which means *which* detail would be interesting to them and *how much* detail they could handle. Telling them more would have been unkind, but telling them less would also have been. I have never subscribed to the view that children need to be protected from certain truths (popular exclusions being death and sex). There are ways to be honest and respectful and at their understanding.

This does not have to be condescending. A teacher trying to teach calculus to her elementary school class would not only be unkind and disrespectful, she would also waste time. A teacher refusing to teach calculus to a specific, interested student merely because she is still in elementary school would be condescending. 

I liked the idea of *soft* light that one TA mentioned. The truth is not hidden, it is there to be seen, but it is not forced on the other. The truth is told in a circuit not to obfuscate or hide but to allow approach from different angles in different circumstances. For example, explaining lightning to a child which is scared in a lightning storm is different to explaining it to a curious kid who is asking why this tree is destroyed, or another scientifically minded kid who is interested why there is light and sound, etc.

In this context I also understand the phrase ""all the truth"". Since the poem is written as advice to the speaker, I take this to mean that the speaker has no right (or at least should avoid) to withhold truth for any reason other than kindness. And, in my opinion, the kindness can only be one about how it is told. Misleading is never kind.

In any case, I see the kindness of slant to be opposed to harsh directness which often does not respect the other.",3

Interesting poem. I really liked the concentration it exposed MM too. It was the most successful one I read during my evaluations.
I think you insert an unnecessary 'they' into the mix when you close read. I would see the first stanza as applicable to the title, so your 'they' becomes my 'Marianne Moore'. Strangely you seem to have not cut all nouns: dozen (in s1); ten (s2) and possibly Marianne (s2); and dark (s3).
I feel you miss the construct which because the method only allows nouns in the title means that the poems view concentrates on those objects. Many of the verbs loose their previous/original attachment to (other) nouns and attach to the title object.
Also, I found it interesting how the polysemic quality of 'the' allowed it a transformation into a pronoun (thee).
I found your speculation on how the method shifted and created new juxtapositions good though I thought you could have been more general about the effect of eliminating nouns. I don't recall you talking about the dropping of words beginning with 's' or discussing how this altered the original.

I like the thesis of this essay that liquor is a metaphor for industrialization of Dickinson&rsquo;s time, as opposed to the purity of nature. I wish the writer had developed this idea more using full quotes instead of just one word to explore the thesis. I also like the idea of the form of this poem being similar to the Psalms of the Bible. This idea should have been supported with quotes from both the Bible and this poem. I wish that the writer had written more about the form of this poem, as it relates to the content. It is important to look beyond the words Dickinson has written. The video discussion about Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;I dwell in possibility&rdquo;, talked about how you had to work to understand Dickinson&rsquo;s poems. The meaning of the poem is not as it always seems on the page. I personally believe that this is a meta-poem, a poem about the way poetry makes one feel as a writer or reader of poetry.
1 Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? Yes. The thesis of the essay contrasts the beauty of nature with industrialization. The writer of the essay used exact quotes from the poem to illustrate their thesis. The first paragraph used several single word quotes such as &ldquo; tippler&rdquo;, &ldquo;inebriate&rdquo;, and &ldquo;debauchee&rdquo;. I would have liked to see the full line quoted to help explain the writer&rsquo;s view about substance abuse and disgrace.2 Does the paper say something about how Dickinson&rsquo;s dashes work? No. The essay did not discuss the use of dashes to emphasize words or create a pause when reading a line.3 Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? The essay does not specifically state that there are four stanzas of four lines each in this poem. It does mention that the form of this poem is like that of the Psalms of the Bible. I like this idea, I just wish the writer had explained this more, and given specific example of how the two were similar.4 Does the way the poem is written account for &ndash;or befit- the story being told about the speaker? The writer of this essay does not explain the story told by each stanza of this poem. The essay begins with alcohol, then in the next paragraph jumps to the last stanza of the poem where religion is referenced. I would have liked to seen specific quotes (whole lines), explaining the writer&rsquo;s thesis about nature, alcohol, and industrialization.5 Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? The paper does not specifically mention a shift in metaphor from liquor in stanza one to nature in summer in stanza two, to the change to nature in fall in stanza three, and finally the change in metaphor to a celestial setting in stanza four. The paper does relate the subjects of alcohol in stanza one to moral degradation, and Dickinson related nature is to religion in the following stanzas.Does the paper account for the way the poem&rsquo;s language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? No. The paper does not discuss how the image of drunkenness is illustrated in the &ldquo;reeling-thro-endless summer days&rdquo; or how the bees and butterflies flying from flower to flower, can be viewed as similar to staggering of a drunk person. The subject of the poem finally rests in the last stanza, the drunk subject has had her fill.

I very much enjoyed reading this author's Bernadette Mayer experiment. &nbsp;The author clearly detailed their process and did a convincing close reading (""the method"" and ""the madness""). &nbsp;I found the essay very interesting and engaging to read.
This assignment seemed to bring out a sense of fun and creativity that I don't recall seeing in the past assignments. &nbsp; I think this author took a great creative leap with coming up with a poem by removing words.
Since the author hinted at wanting to hear readers' interpretation of this version of ""Incident"" here's mine: The speaker recalls a memory where they rode into town, full of hope and thoughts. &nbsp;And they saw an unspecified happy incident and a beautiful view of Cape May from their vantage point. &nbsp;The speaker's inarticulate words can be thought of a happy stutter, or recalling an incident from long ago, where the details are now fuzzy. &nbsp;
I enjoyed this essay -- well done!

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
I appreciate your fine response to the essay assignment. Now it is time for me to do what I can to evaluate your essay using the rubric above. Though you did not explicitly touch on condensation, grammar, prepositions, or subjectivity (#1-4), yours is the only essay of the four assigned to me that discussed tradition (#5) at all -- great job! You state: ""This piece completely destroys the 'Madonna' maternal image."" And then you back up your statement. I especially enjoyed your insight about how thoughts are gathered. You write that ""in Version 2 the thoughts are broken between stanzas causing you to slow down the tempo."" I hadn't realized that occurred until you brought it to my attention. Thank you for that insight!

Essay
Perhaps it is best to start by going over the points of the imagist manifesto one by one and indicate how version 2 is somewhat more in conformance (if indeed). Towards the end, it might be possible to come up with a more general statement integrating the observations.
1. Common speech, exact words - a significant omission from the second version is the description of the child being a &ldquo;thief&rdquo; of sorts robbing his mother (of what - we are left to assume) - &ldquo;this little child / who robs her // knows nothing of / his theft&rdquo;. I find myself needing to quote &ldquo;thief&rdquo; - mainly because this is not the exact usage for thievery &amp; robbing. In common speech one robs articles, possessions, items of tangible presence and value. The application of such an action to the emotional world is the very thing that the imagists are moving away from. So, by the removal of this metaphorical usage of robbing the second version is more of an imagist poem.
2. Free verse rather an conventional form - both versions employ a similar structure, a kind of a staccato of short verses. The poems can almost be read as one continues sentence and the breakage seem to be almost be arbitrary - so in this respect both version adhere to the manifesto. In closer reading of version 2 I find that the stanzas are somewhat interconnected to each other by way of a form of linkage or continuation, with the second line of each stanza linked to the first line of the next (tears on her cheek, her cheek on her hand, the child in her lap, his nose pressed). So this is a play in form - the stanza breaks are playing against the content of the poem. This might count as a more imagist use of the language - going against the grain - against conventional form. This might also be an expression of the tension between the mother and child using the form and stanza breaks rather then content.
3. Absolute freedom in choice of subject - the subject of both poems seems to be young-women/little-child couplet. Knowing WCW, this is probably a suburban scene - a scene risen from the proximity of houses laid against the communal distance between residences. With the removal of the robbing metaphor, the second version is a bit more &ldquo;flat&rdquo; in its subject - merely descriptive of the couple and not touching on their emotional interaction. Still, I find the two versions comparable in their conformity.
4. To present an image - The first version, starts out with a &ldquo;while&rdquo; clause, continues with a descriptive body and ends with a &ldquo;but&rdquo; ending/conclusion. It does not paint a picture but rather describes the dynamics of a situation. The woman, cheek, hand a child and there to setup and drive home the affect - a robbery is taking place in this quite suburban house. This is drama, not imagery. The second version does away with the &ldquo;while/but&rdquo; structure and removes the act of robbery - leaving the poem as a simple and clean description of an image - a set of objects (she, cheek, hand, child, lap, nose, glass) and prepositions (on her, in her, pressed to) to join them into a snapshot, a thing you will simply notice while you drive by the house.
5. Poetry which is hard and clear - a part from arguments provided before as to the enhanced clarity of version 2, one can also add the introduction of the glass material directly in the second version. Glass is a hard and yet clear material. It also has a role in other WCW poems - broken or as a barrier (between neighbors here).
6.&nbsp;Concentration - finally, the second version, shorted by the above mentioned omissions, is much more condensed, concentrated both in form (shorter) and content (the image itself rather then the emotional dynamics).
The summarize, the second version is a more of an imagist poem, by way of conformance at least (if not be author intent).

This is a very well written essay. There is no mention of the dashes, but everything else is fully covered. You did&nbsp; a great job breaking down the stanzas and talking the feeling in each one. I love the thought of the angels coming to play with the drunkard. That is a very good take on the angels and one that I myself did not see when reading this poem.

While you say you feel ""slightly lost"" in the world of poetry, I appreciate how you used the reading to find your way through this poem which has so many possible meanings and pathways to understanding the images and shifting metaphors.  You stayed true to your experience and came out with some possible interpretations you many not have considered when you initially read the poem.

I hadn't considered a reference to fairies, and like how that plays with another possible meaning in her images.  

Overall, I recommend ""playing"" with the images more, maybe doing some free-associations with the images before settling down to plough through for a set meaning...  get a little inebriated with the poetry itself... the poems may just open up some more to you.

good work!    ",2

Bravo! The first essay I read that mentions every aspect of the poem - the use of dashes, form, feeling induced by both and ofcourse the different meanings the words and metaphors might have.
I like how the writer doesnt take ""one interpretation"" but gives us different takes and then even why one ""version"" is more valid than the other by method of elimination! Even certain sounds ('I' and 'ck') haven been takin into consideration, something, I must admit, that I have totally missed ^^
He/she even mentiones how there is a shift from summer to later when the angles shake their hats to release snow -&gt; arrival of winter. Good job!
If you want some ""nit-picking"" from me ^^ then MAYBE a bit more about the rhyme-sheme, if this poem could be considered a balad or not and a tiny bit more linking the actual words of Emily that represent/reflect your interpretation. But again, that nit-picking.
Very interesting read! Keep up the good work!
Well done.

And I think you hit upon what's poetic about chance operation that uses a source text! It's not, as some would claim, lazy or plagiarizing, it's a very meaningful gesture calculated to simultaneously say something about the source text, expression, poetry and rhetoric generally. The gesture of the setup or the form communicates a frustration with conventional media reporting and rhetoric and provides an alternative writing method to counteract that tired method that isn't working anymore according to Jena. The poem created by the operation, bearing in mind the process, asks the reader to critically or close read language s/he wouldn't have otherwise, does a kind of re-contextualizing.",1

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
Well the writer is bit good to have the second form as the appreciable one and not quite interetsed to notice the first one. He brings the consideration of second one as the most sorted after for true explaination where the underlined story is baking a plot and not the one that is cooking no new issue for improvement in the lane.&nbsp;
But the usage of words like""Silly and nonsense"" brings a kind of harsh mannerism to the close reading of the poem. Though, he has stated his own points but the way of providing the same seems bit tough.&nbsp;

Yes it will be part of the language of the relationship between husband and wife and may well be a poem also about Williams enjoying his wife as saved/prepared for him.  This is just to say...I love you/what you do and look what I can do with my craft and yours...here is a poem.  The response is acknowledgement and reminder of how much she contributes to his life and that whilst the plums were eaten that is much less a problem...the poetry and his satisfying his needs than the intrusion of his work at times.

Meantime, let me just say that on Tuesday I will suddenly have more time on my hands, and I will feel utterly bereft, and will begin to miss all my new ModPo friends (there are MANY of those). But fortunately, the next day begins a journey to my parents' home - they are still in the home where I grew up - where all my family will converge to celebrate not just American Thanksgiving but also my parents' 60th wedding anniversary. That will keep me focused through the following Sunday. The shift of attention will be good, because otherwise I think I would be very low without our ModPo. We'll see how I handle the following week.

It feels like what I feel when I read and really ponder Ashbery's line in ""Some Trees"" (great poem): ""we are surrounded."" It feels like the moment when I learned how to ride a bike and just took off, not knowing quite how to stop, nor what I was pedaling toward.

The essay speculates notes the four omitted words and the destablizing effect on form of their omission. &nbsp;The poem does seem harsher due to the omission of the modifiers/qualifiers. &nbsp;On a second read, the experiment appears to be advocating telling the truth in circuitous lies. &nbsp;The essay therefore appropriately points out that the harshness of the experiemental version highlights Dickinson's attention to form and subtlety. &nbsp;Her slant. &nbsp;THe essay points out that this contrast is the value of the experiment.

I enjoyed reading this essay. I imagined the essayist making the essay's points in a public performance with hand gestures. Very cool.
1. Condensation: The essay speaks of version 2 being more concentrated by the removal of vague and indefinite words and the issue of the thieving child being taken out.
2. Grammar: The essay makes a claim that version 2 begins with a composite sentence, and further word choice decisions make version 2 more in line with imagism's concern to use common speech and exacting precision.
3. Prepositions: Prepositions are not addressed.
4. Subjectivity: The speaker is not addressed.
5. Tradition: Tradition is not addressed.

The essay makes note of the way Dickinson has used the form of the poem to show a sense of cycle and seasonal time passing. The author has argued this with reference to the punctuation, language choice and form. The writer notes the dashes but could comment more on how they are employed by Dickinson in this poem to create meaning.&nbsp;The author discusses the possible outcome for the speaker for the poet but could expand further on their argument. Their isnt any mention of the original conceit and or shift in metaphor of this poem.&nbsp;

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay of approximately 500 words.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why I Am Not a Painter&rdquo; is a fabulous meta-poem that describes how liberating it feels to write.
Poetry is much more satisfying than painting, according to the last two stanzas. O&rsquo;Hara is a poet because poetry evokes life, while painting is just lines. Mike Goldberg starts his painting with the word &ldquo;SARDINES&rdquo; but when he is finished only letters are left, the word is obliterated, and the idea of SARDINES is gone. All Goldberg has at the end is &ldquo;just letters&rdquo;. Goldberg names his painting SARDINES, evoking the idea of pentimento, when earlier efforts show under layers of paint. In contrast to Goldberg&rsquo;s destruction, O&rsquo;Hara starts his poem thinking about the color orange and writes about life without ever mentioning orange. He starts with a line, but the poem needs more of life and because he is satisfied with the poem we infer that he has written about life. This is confirmed when the page fills up with &ldquo;words, not lines&rdquo;. O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s words convey meaning; Goldberg&rsquo;s lines are just lines.
The New York School does not really have principles; their poems do not embody a philosophy other than exuberance. Instead they have a set of techniques, which are well exploited in this poem.
O&rsquo;Hara uses the New York School techniques of humor, irony, and friendship with painters to make fun of Goldberg without being offensive. O&rsquo;Hara has big doses of irony in his comparisons. Each artist starts with the other&rsquo;s basic building block, a word for the painter and a color for the poet. He and Goldberg both name their artworks after a missing word; SARDINES was present but was destroyed, and ORANGES was never present but is vibrant. It is ironic that the title that Goldberg chooses is a living animal but his painting is dead letters, but ORANGES is pigment and the poem is about life.
The New York School poets explore techniques of narrative experimentation, and, again, this poem embraces narrative exploration. The poem does not use pure narrative because it has the I-do-this-I-do-that quality and takes several readings to reveal action. This is heightened by the three uses of &ldquo;days go by&rdquo; to describe skips in the linear narrative flow. We don&rsquo;t know if Goldberg and O&rsquo;Hara worked at the same time, or even several years apart, and so the two stanzas may not be sequential. But it is somewhat narrative because the second and third stanzas each tell the story of creation of a piece of art from beginning to end. The &ldquo;I&ldquo; knows from the first line where the poem will end, mitigating the I-do-this-I-do-that effect. The ambiguous use of the pronouns is another New York School technique which is used here. In the second stanza, the &ldquo;it&rdquo; is always a painting and in the third the &ldquo;it&rdquo; is always a poem, but &ldquo;it&rdquo; unifies the poem by always referring to art.
Playing with the narrative form conveys the sense that O&rsquo;Hara is at the center of a creative tumult. Art is a competitive sport and O&rsquo;Hara wins.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
Hi
&nbsp;
This was a very short essay. It would have been good to focus &nbsp;on what the poem does. YOu seem to come to some very strong, clear concluisons about the nature of art. What part (if any) did the poem play in helping you come ot those conclusions? For example, what effect did the ""chatty"" style have on you? What about the way he slips in the terribleness of life at the end of a sentence?
YOu claim that both painting and poem are art and will remain art, and state that the creator has the right to name their creation. Did you see any humour in the poem? What about when he says ""I'm a real poet. I even write in prose.""? That made me laugh, because he didn't sem to be taking himself to seriously, even though his subject could be seen as quite serious.
YOu don't mention the ""I do this I do that"" style of the poem. What do you think it adds to the poem? Nor do you make any mention of ""metapoetry."" What does teh poem tell you about what it's like ot write poetry?
&nbsp;
YOur fellow student,
&nbsp;

Very amusing concluding sentence. I also interpreted the title as ironic, and the poem as expressing a number of similarities between painters and poets &ndash; in terms of artistic processes &ndash;so I don&rsquo;t think your essay is why you are not an essayist :) I think your essay could have been improved by a bit more of a discussion of how O&rsquo;Hara used structure, and possibly a bit more of an analysis of the New York School style. Overall good job.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
Condensation: The essay does note that version 2 is shorter than version 1. I really like the explanation of the stanza's, with the threads and wanting to read further!&nbsp;
Grammar: The essay does note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions. Again with the threads and also with the words that were cut from the second version.&nbsp;

To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
Nice essay, what I like mostly is fine language analysis. You give very interesting and detailed explanation of the word ""liquor"", its metaphor and lots of meanings, and ""tankards"" and many others. Stanzaic forms and rhymes are analysed effectively, but dashes are not mentioned. As regards main thesis, I think that it is too simple, that there are lots of senses in the poem, but I must say, that you follow your concept during the whole essay and prove it very well. Your essay could tell us more about the story of the lyrical character, here it seems too short.

The essay does an excellent job of explaining why Version 2 better reflects the Imagist programme. The major word changes are accounted for, and concision and precision are clearly shown. Some of the higher-level points suggested in the model evaluation guidelines are not present, but these were not clearly requested in the assignment. Good job, and that it was well-written made it a pleasure to read.

I really enjoyed your understanding of the poem; it's close to my own interpretation, but you picked out some details that I hadn't considered, so it broadened my own interpretation of the poem.
I especially liked your insight into who the landords and butterflies are: ""people who in one or more ways discourage others or themselves from seeing how wonderful life around them really is"" and ""people [who] will only occasionally see the wonder of life, for example when falling in love"". Nicely said. I struggled a bit with Dickinson's meaning, wondering what it meant that the bees were turned out by the landlords and the butterflies had renounced their dram and I think your interpretation fits perfectly with Dickinson's overall point in the poem. I also liked your idea that she is discussing the end of her life at the end of the poem.&nbsp;
While you didn't discuss her use of dashes, I realize that the main idea of your essay didn't leave you a lot of room to analyze that in such a short essay assignment. I think you did a fair job of discussing the stanzaic form, as well as the story being told by Dickinson, in that you clearly outlined the progression of the poem, as well as commented on how she builds her case by increasing the extent and quality of her drinking (from the man-made world to nature to heaven itself). In this way, you also begin to deal with the purpose of her shifting metaphor.
Overall, well done. In such a short amount of time I think you provided a clear and partially detailed close reading of Dickinson's poem.

1) condensation: This essay notes the use of superfluous words in version 1-- little, and there, for instance-- and their removal from version 2.
2) grammar, syntax: This essay notes the distracting effect of the structure of version 1, in which the opening phrase, beginning with ""while,"" creates a diversion to a ""parallel event,"" and ""introduces a temporal dimension,"" resulting in anti-Imagist vagueness. The writer also mentions how the subject of version 1, the child, moves in and out of focus in version 1.
3) prepositions: This essay does not discuss prepositions.
4) subjectivity: This essay asks whose subjectivity is voiced in the poem. and decides that it could be that of the poet or of the child. This essay takes the position that the poet's subjectivity intrudes excessively in version 1, and that version 2 leaves more room for the reader's own interpretations and subjectivity.
5) pictorial tradition: The art historical tradition of representations of the Madonna and Child is not discussed.
This essay pays close attention to the cadence of the poem, and compares meter to the brush strokes of a painted canvas. The writer proposes that the cadence of version 1 is more mechanical and less expressive than the variety of rhythms in version 2, in which ""every stanza has a new cadence."" ( I found this point interesting, but I read it the opposite way-- I thought version 2 was more monotonous, and that its monotony added to its impact. )

You talk about the relationship between your source material and the new mesostic and intepret it through that lense. Some advice that I got on my own mesostic that I think might apply here as well is to try reading your mesostic without that context in mind, to try and find a new interpretation unrelated to the source.&nbsp;
But, great work! Hope you've enjoyed the class!

Here is a guide for assessing and commenting on essay #1 (close reading of Dickinsonâ€™s â€œI taste a liquor never brewedâ€). Please answer, at least briefly, all five sets of questions. Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? In other words, does the essay quote and/or in other ways account for the actual words used by poet? We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? Once youâ€™ve noted and remarked on whether the essay discusses these things, comment on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay does so.Does the paper say something about how Dickinsonâ€™s dashes works? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay deals with the dashes? Does the paper account in some way for the stanzaic form? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly it discusses how the poemâ€™s form interacts with its content. For most essays that deal with this topic, the discussion will describe the way in which the speakerâ€™s figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble.Does the way the poem is written account for â€“ or befit â€“ the â€œstoryâ€ being told about the speaker? If yes, then please remark on how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly the essay handles this issue.Does the paper in some way follow the shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the paper account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so? 
Extremely well crafted essay that demonstrates the wholeness of the poem in both content and form. The reference to the Bible in relation to Pearl and the note on the capitalization of words to show importance, demonstrates the metaphor of nature and God as the essayist here wrote.&nbsp; The theme of authority versus openness is carefully constructed in the essay and reinforced by the discussion of the dash to signal an eternity that cannot be captured.
The presentation of the essay shows how each stanza moves and ambulates in a drunken way, to and from, swaying from the power and its limitlessness, yet still aware of the struggle between man and nature, as is the struggle of beast with nature.
The paper addresses the metaphoric language employed by Dickinson to show the transient nature of of man's intoxication, and in some ways, intoxication of man with nature, as man questions God, and is turned out by God, and struggles with God and God's plan. If God turns man out of the garden, then man must find a way to capture that essence. The essay invokes that with the discussion of the inn as sky and inn as flower. Man can plant flowers, hence, man can ""capture"" the essence of God, but man can't create the sky, although will try to conquere it.

Essay
So Much Depends Upon&hellip; Profound Interiority
Essay by [REDACTED] for Coursera / Modern and Contemporary American Poetry; Assignment 2; 10/7/2012
The deft imagist poet carries the reader into the personal intimate inner world by using sparing expression and precise penetrating visual clarity. Shunning ornamentation and showy emotionality, the imagist uses dry concision and exact simplicity to reveal and enshrine that inner world, causing its subtle potent landscapes to emerge in direct familiar emotional tangibility. In doing so, the imagist conveys the reader from word and page to a direct experience of the self in a manner fundamentally real and affirming: From exercise in poetics to depth of interiority, and at best into profound interiority.
William Carlos Williams&rsquo; created two versions of the poem, ""Young Woman at a Window"", one sent into the world via publication, the other bedded safely away in a store of personal papers, his intention for it unknown. Of the two versions, the second is most true to the imagist manifesto.
Both versions frame a single moment; A young woman sits with tears on her cheek. Both speak in spare free verse. Both convey gentle longing or sorrow without explicitly revealing source or cause. Both brief, relying on repetition of simple words and phrases in simple irregular cadence.
Beyond these common traits, there are clear differences. The first, the published version, is more complex. It uses more words, some unnecessary, to convey meaning. Unfortunately, these occasionally distract us from the core emotional pull of the base imagery. The first word &ldquo;while&rdquo; is used to tell that something is happening concurrent with her sitting. We do not need to be told. The first stanza of version 1 ends without the emotional anchor of &ldquo;tears&rdquo;, so expertly introduced straightaway in version 2 with the direct thrust of the first phrase &ldquo;she sits with tears&rdquo;. &ldquo;Her cheek on her hand&rdquo; and effective image of frozen in thought&hellip;or feeling&rdquo;, perhaps pensive or forlorn used in both versions.
Version 1 then proceeds to introduce the complexity and distraction of the &ldquo;child who robs her&rdquo; and the &ldquo;theft&rdquo; it &ldquo;knows nothing of&rdquo;. The image of theft or robbery may set up drama or perhaps a stunning and resonant image, but it takes us quickly away from the place where we already stand within the interior life of our young woman. The &ldquo;theft&rdquo; the child &ldquo;knows nothing of&rdquo; injects unnecessary generality and vagueness. Even worse, the vagueness is somewhat mysterious and compelling, inviting analytic thought, and therefore further undermining the imagists resolve to render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities. Additionally, the phrase &ldquo;this little child who robs her&rdquo; is somewhat ornamental, decorative without meaningful substance. (Of course we now know her sadness is from loss of youthful freedom and the carefree life, but this adds very little to our interior experience. It&rsquo;s essentially a wasteful image. The same is true of the image of the child rubbing his nose. This is an ornament that conveys detachment or innocence, but unnecessarily. We do not need this to deepen our passion for our young woman.
The imagery of second version is more concise, compact and compelling. It takes us home to interior meaning and affect quickly, and holds us there. It cradles us in deep interiority by letting us rest with the simple single image of &ldquo;she sits with tears&rdquo;. The image is direct, pointed, clear, and simple. The role of the child is simply to be present. He does not command our attention, but his presence gently and powerfully warms and accompanies our inner empathy with her tears of sadness.
Finally &ldquo;the glass&rdquo;: The child presses his nose &ldquo;to the glass&rdquo;. We now know that our young woman looks out&hellip;or in. Is the glass a window or a mirror? With our young woman do we look out, to a world that she cannot access, that has hurt her, that calls to her? Or do we look within, to her heart, her longing, to her hurt? The true power of the image of the glass is that it does not require a reason or explanation as to why she looks. We have the essentials: She sits. She sheds tears. She looks. When the question ""Why does she look?"" arises in the mind the reader is already well within the deep interior of the self. The simple economy of imagery of the second version has carried the reader to profound interiority&hellip;.uncluttered emotion&hellip; where we rest and savor. Just as the adept imagist would have us do.

Evaluation rubric:

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
You do speak a lot about the formal elements and provide some analytical background on how O'Hara's poem is like the elements of the painters that he was associating with at that time.&nbsp; You do have a mention of the poem called ""Oranges"" and the painting called ""Sardines"" but I would like to have heard more about what you think the differences and / or similiarities are about them.
Your point of ""saying I am a real poet"" is right on as far as how O'Hara felt meta-poetically.&nbsp; It is a poem about writing poetry as it is influenced by abstract art.&nbsp; That was good.&nbsp; I do like your conclusion that ""he may bring all forms of art into the writing"" - I don't know if you meant this to mean art as paint on canvas but it made me think all forms of art: music, sculpture, architecture, dance etc ... that infomed these guys about new things to do in the media that they chose to work within (not to mention guys like Cage who would work in multiple media).&nbsp; This was all very liberating and we enjoy that liberation ourselves today.

Thoughtful and well-researched essay. &nbsp;The essay takes Dickinson's poems and breaks down the most important metaphors. &nbsp;I particularly enjoyed this person's reading of each stanza as working from the ground up to reach a sense of enlightenment or rapture in the natural realm. &nbsp;The writer addresses Dickinson's use of dashes as a device used to open the poem to the reader and at the same time make the reader pause at certain points. &nbsp;The writer highlights each stanza as an individual image in Dickinson's mind which equates to her heightened euphoria in nature. &nbsp;This was truly an interesting read. &nbsp;The writer covers all of the points in the essay prompt with thought and precision. &nbsp;

The writer of the essay does go beyond the what, to the how - for example, speaking in the first paragraph of how he or she&nbsp;thinks it is clear that the poet is speaking of life experiences she is just discovering.
The writer notes the last dash; and suggests that this device 'is hinting toward the fact, again, that she will never stop drinking the liquor or breathing the air.'
The essay does touch upon the story, unfolding it as a sequence of events.

As regards the general metaphor of the poem, I think it was quite understood and very well explained. I myself share the same interpretation of the poem, and you've opened my mind to some lines that where a bit confusing and now after reading your essay I perfectly agree with you.&nbsp;
The only ""critic"" I can make is about the form of the poem ""helps"" to the whole interpretation of it. I think rhyme and rhythm are very important here, as much as the metaphor does. It was no clear mention to these particular resourses. But on the other side, as I said, I think it was well explained the ""how"" the poet tells the story and comunicates the idea she wants us to get.&nbsp;
I very much liked this interpretation!&nbsp;

Essay
The cadence of the second poem -- over the first -- is more conversational; the words have a natural rhythm that describes the essence of imagism -- a simply stated scene that we can ponder and consider as we probe for a meaning if we want to find a ""meaning."" The second poem with its spare language allows a look at feelings we might conjure, now or later. The first version doesn't have that spareness because of its complicated wording.&nbsp;
The first version forces us to untangle descriptive words -- ""robs her,"" ""knows nothing,"" ""his theft."" We are left with unanswered questions and certainly uncertain answers.&nbsp;
More so than the first, the second, with its spare active voice, uses forceful words to depict and describe the scene of a woman distressed, or happy, and yet she holds a child who symbolically looks out to the outside world of hope or possibly even despair. We have a choice with the second; the first asks us to ponder.&nbsp;
Unlike the first, the second poem wants us to image the starkness of the scene. Why is the woman sad, or is she crying with tears of joy? The child is juxtaposed between tears of sadness or happiness with his/her nose to the glass; the choice is ours.
The nose pressed to the glass could anticipate the arrival of a father/lover who is leaving or coming home; again the emotion of the second version's words allows us to imagine the scene simply. We can then turn to our emotional response(s).&nbsp;
The first poem with its descriptive and unresolved words only clouds; the spareness of the second illuminates on a personal level. &nbsp;

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Emily Dickinson's poem starts with the ""I"" &mdash; and if we think, like the discussion video group, that Emily the Poet is speaking in ""I dwell in Possibility,"" then I would like to assume she speaks in ""I taste a liquor never brewed.""
When read that way, the poem takes us through the highs and lows of being and thinking like a poet, in relation to the highs and lows of the drinker, probably drunkard: Poetry, like alcohol, as stiumulant and depressant. Drunkards drink alcohol, while poets ""drink in"" the world around them.
Dickinson is at play right from the beginning. Liquor is distilled, not brewed. Yet a ""Tankard"" is a tall mug of beer &mdash; which is brewed &mdash; and her ""Vats upon the Rhine"" signify Germany, land of the beer.
Now, in our second stanza, Dickinson is drunk with ""air"" and indulging in ""dew."" These are natural terms and signify outside &mdash; maybe gardens? &mdash; and the morning.
Cooped up in her home, as the author was, the ""Reeling &mdash; thro' endless summer days &mdash;"" invites a feeling of stuffiness of being inside that the morning would help alleviate.
Molten blue signifies an intense sadness, and double meaning of flowing water or, possibly ice, because of the connection with molten lava. Molten means melted. An endless summer day could certainly do some melting. And using the term ""inn"" connects the stanza with the next, which I find particularly strong in its connections to bars, pubs, etc.
I've thought about why the terms ""Landlords"" and ""drams"" are used in quotations in the poem and cannot develop a good answer. But this metaphor works in our ""nature and garden"" theme used above, as well as the reality of bars for regulars &mdash; which I find personally palpable.
A ""drunken Bee"" can be any one of a bar's regular customers who sit and talk and create that general buzz that one experiences at a bar &mdash; a town bar &mdash; in the evening. And what a wonderful name for a town bar &mdash; ""the Foxglove,"" which of course is also a pastel flower that bees would actually pollinate. A flower's door would be where a bee would enter.
""Butterflies,"" a term that doubles as a frivolous person &mdash; like social butterfly &mdash; take a ""dram,"" or small amount of nectar in the same way a bar patron would take a small amount of liquor in a shot glass.
There is a limit to how much someone can drink in any given sitting, yet for the poet, who is drinking in life around her: ""I shall but drink the more!"" Is there a limit for poets? Maybe for some, but not for Dickinson.
In the final stanza Dickinson does not use the word ""I,"" but it seems ""the little Tippler"" is a reference to her. As in ""The spreading wide my narrow Hands/To gather Paradise &mdash;"" here we have a small poet, who is high &mdash; a word with a double meaning related to alcohol &mdash; in the sky by the sun.
The last stanza seems to have a meaning I cannot quite reach. Perhaps Dickinson was aware that others who were less talented to her received much more attention. That had to bother her. The people in her home, like her sister, had no idea of her genius. Was that difficult? She is taking her clearly small, unnoticed stature (at home) and casting it large over all eternity (in Paradise watched and cheered by seraphs and saints).

This essay quotes generously from the poem, and the quotes are incorporated seamlessly to illustrate and expand the essayist's account of the poem.&nbsp; By characterizing the dashes as ""hiccups"" and accounting for the ""slant"" form of the poem as reflexive of its theme, the essayist does a very good job of close reading for a ""story"" of the poem that hews closely to the way the poem is written.&nbsp; The essay also provides a key to several of the poem's metaphors, citing two possible interpretations of the seraphs' ""snowy hats"".

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Brewing is a process of corruption. Bacteria consumes sugar and then die in their own waste which is forms alcohol. Dickinson is imbibing something uncorrupt from a vessel that is hollowed out from pearl, a natural precious substance caused by an irritation over time. This is not an earthy drink, it doesn't come from the best drink on earth (vats upon the Rhine) which would be a German beer, but from somewhere else.
This is a drink made from air and dew. She is drunk from the sky. The air in invisible. The dew comes from the air and appears miraculously in the morning as if from the sky, which is molten blue. The hot sky of summer. Subsequent stanzas imply we are moving through the seasons, through time.
The world landlord is in scare quotes [1]. Research tells that this term was not used until after the 19th century. However, one can infer that it still meant that the author is implying that there is some irony in the word landlords. No human is really lord over the land. Possibly it is the distant future when bees are turned out of the flowers.
To turn a drunken bee out of the foxglove's door is to deny the bee it sustenance and also it's pleasure. Foxglove is also called digitalis and so has a medicinal connotation. It is used as a palliative for the heart. The entomoloy of the flowers name is obscure, but a 19th century source suggests Foxglove [2] is said to be the place where faeries reside.
Dickinson might be likening the bee to a Faerie. More obscurely, Foxglove is said to come from the word ""foxes'glew"" which is another name for music or instrument. This is discounted at the source, but the flower is also bell shaped. Dickinson is using this ""swarm"" of associations to imply a connection to sound and magic and back to the bee, which is small, as is she.
The butterfly renounces it's drams. Drams is a word meaning weight and volume, but obscurely it means a very small amount of liqueur. In this stanza taken together Dickinson is implying that the time of the poem is speeding into a far future. The end of nature, eternity. Where those who are immortal meet.
A Seraph [3] is a fire angel residing around the throne of the deity. To say that a Seraph would swing a snowy hat implies that the snow is cold indeed. It's possible that this is from Dante and inverts the angel into a demon in the last circle of hell, which is near absolute zero, so far it is away from god. Even the saint is called away from their devotions to see Dickinson is a little tippler leaning against the sun, still warm though the fire angels are topped with snow.
In short the poet apprehends an uncorrupted nature in all it's wholeness over time. She leans against the centrality of the system of planets, long in the future, seen from an eternal perspective. The irritating things of life cause the cup, in which a marvelous intoxicant. made of invisible elements, gathers over time. Higher beings recognize this other being as marvelous and as indestructible as a being who is becoming can be.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay of approximately 500 words.
To be quite honest, I found it very difficult to understand the central argument of the poem, that is, why O'Hara is a poet and not a painter. What I see in the poem, on the contrary, is a paralelism between painting and writing. I haven't really found any strong argument to support the idea that the title of the poem suggests.I think he is making a comparison, a paralelism, between the different approaches in the process of creating a work of art in painting and writing. In a way he is showing us the transformation and the different ""steps"" that the artist faces when creating art. I see this in the fact that he at first sees the sardines in Mike's painting, which are then kind of ""lost"" in the process, and, in the same way, how the original idea of his poem (the orange color) then is also lost in the complex process of producing and signifying art, to the point that when both works are finished, one could barely understand the main idea or concept of the work, which is emphasized by the fact that the title of the work refers to this ""original idea"" which was ""lost"" in the way or transformed into several other things, making the reader or viewer of the work being lost or confused.
One possible way in which he prefers poetry than painting, is maybe the conceptual possibilities of writing, that is inevitable full of meaning (""There should be so much more, not of orange, of words, of how terrible orange is and life.""), and the way in which the poet can describle a specific thing without even mention it at all.
The New York School principles and idea are developed in the poem in the fact that the poem is very individual. It's always ""I"". The poet explains a ""universal issue"" (creating and signifying art) thorugh a personal experience, always in a self-referential way. Also we can see the I-do-this I-do-that style all over the poem, mixing actual historical expericences (such as droping in Mike Goldberg's art shop) with non-temporal ideas or working experiences (such as the creation of a poem or set of poems).

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem is considered more imagist than version 1. This rubric addresses those specific ways in five different questions. As you evaluate your peers' essays, please answer, at least briefly, all five questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive.   Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where in the open the condensation has occurred? Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a â€œWhileâ€-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word â€œthisâ€ in â€œthis little child.â€ If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after â€œher handâ€ and before â€œthis little child.â€ The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences? Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (â€œwith,â€ â€œon,â€ â€œin,â€ â€œtoâ€) and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version use prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects? Subjectivity: Now for the most difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location or subjectivity of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a â€œyoung womanâ€ and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. Readers naturally wonder if there is a father â€œin the picture,â€ as it were. Has he left them alone? Is he the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on subjectivity in the poem should be praised! Tradition: Some interpreters might want to say that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of - this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a â€œMake It Newâ€ approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? If so, does it identify such a â€œquotationâ€ from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the objective of identifying imagist aspects of this writing? 
A short and convincing essay which accounts for mostly all aspects of the poems discussed.The scaffolding is a well-chosen term and accurately describes the unfolding images that compose the text. It is to be noted the mention of the prepositional ""engine"" that create the image frame by frame as well as the idea of taking the potential viewer/writer=poet into account as being a witness. I therefore consider the essay a successful one that covers most of the important points which should be considered when reading William's versions of ""the Woman..."". Good job and congratulations!

Frank O'Hara's
 poem draws on the principles and ideas of the New York School to say something about the differences between poetry and painting. This rubric asks four different questions about how an essay approaches this topic. As you evaluate your peers'
 essays, please try to respond to topics raised in the four questions. However, please also feel free to comment on other aspects of the essay you find striking or suggestive and to ignore aspects of questions below that don't seem relevant to the essay's approach.

1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem expresses O'Hara's
preference for being a poet and not a painter? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does - how it uses its formal elements - as much as we think about what it says.) 

2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's
view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara
 called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike
Goldberg called ""Sardines""? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?

3. New York School: Does the essay successfully integrate into its discussion the ""New York School"" style of
I-do-this-I-do-that? Does it attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract discussion of differences between two arts?

4. Meta-poetry:  Does the essay emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's
writing here? Does it, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange
yet"" or in O'Hara's
quoting Mike Goldberg asserting that his
""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the meta-poetic qualities of O'Hara's
 poem: the poem is a poem about a painting and a poem about the poet's
 preference for poetry.
This essayist is satirizing the New York poet by writing a New York style poem about New York style art.&nbsp;
I found myself laughing out loud, and explaining the poem on the phone to a writer friend who just called me this morning to borrow my car.
He exhibits rather than explains the New York style, and it works very well, in my opinion, exhibiting that the essayist grasps everything about that style to the point of replicating it.&nbsp; He so intergrates it into the discussion, that he does it and satirizes the I do this, I do that, and the competative cross fertilization of the poet and painter.
My friend reminded me on the phone that all true art is spiritual, because it comes from a unformed source which is inspiration, but really who knows what that is.&nbsp; The essayist captures that aspect of the creative force is his satire, as well.&nbsp;
I think this a a job well done, to say the least.

There was no discussion of meta-poetry, but instead, the essay shows that the omission of the word 'oranges' was intentional.

The essay does an excellent job of interpreting Dickinson's metaphors and motifs. I particularly liked the suggestion that Dickinson was poking fun at herself and that the poem could be showing support for the temperance movement; this was something that hadn't occurred to me. It also remarks on her use of dashes throughout the poem to echo the staggering or reeling motion of the poem's inebriated author and to lend emphasis to certain words, like ""Sun.""&nbsp;

My Creative Experiment
I opted for Option B: Bernadette Mayer Experiment. Actually it is a combination of a few ideas in Mayer's list of experiments. I took a famous line from William Shakespeare's Macbeth and a list of the names of perfumes and mixed the words from the line with the names of perfumes to achieve a result. The line I took is from the sleep-walking scene and the words are uttered by Lady Macbeth.
I chose some twenty five somewhat dark names of perfumes that seemed relevant in the context of the play, and narrowed my list to eleven to match the number of words in the line chosen. I arranged the names of perfumes vertically in alphabetical order and I put a word each of Lady Macbeth, in vertical order, against a perfume. What emerged in the end surprised me because it seemed to have acquired a few meanings. I tried several ways of arranging words, but finally settled for this one. I chose the title Red &amp; Black for two reasons: a) the colors symbolize blood and night that dominate the play Macbeth;&nbsp;b) the colors are the names of two perfumes mentioned in the poem.&nbsp;

The point has been made that she is 'elitist'. Well I have my objections to that term being used as much as our trying to interpret her from a 20th C. feminist stand point.

This essay discusses and explains the poem more than adequately. The first paragraph is solid and deals with the speaker's intoxication commendably. The second paragraph deals with the subject of illusion and false reality, whilst I would not question the validity of the argument - its link to the poem is rather tenuous; the author asserts that the subjective experience of the speaker is false yet includes no reference to the text to support this claim. I do feel the argument is on the right track but simply over-extends itself. I think the reader can certainly feel a sense of doubt and unease over the veracity of the speaker's account; however, there does not seem to be enough evidence to render it false. Too much depends upon the author's own experience with alcohol. The Whitman reference is&nbsp;unneccesary.
The essay does not comment upon the use of dashes.
The essay does not comment upon the stanzaic form.
The essay does deal with the story of the poem. The speaker's journey is clearly plotted out within the essay.
The essay does deal with the shifts in metaphor. The author certainly notices shifts in metaphor, explaining when the speaker's experiences align with certain metaphors and when these metaphors become inadequate.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay.
Dickinson uses the contrast between the motif of humanity and the imagery of nature with the transition through the seasons in her structure to show how man is never satisfied with what he has. The author uses the persona to show this through the way she always hopes for the wine when it isn&rsquo;t there and abuses it when it is.
Each of the stanzas in the poem depict a different season. Each of these seasons describe the persona being unhappy and hoping for the next. This is shown through the imagery used by the author as well as how she is described. Beginning with Spring in the first stanza and until winter in the last, we see the persona always longing for what the next season of the year will bring.
The first stanza paints a picture of spring through the use of nature imagery as well as a play of words in the title. It seems like the persona is anticipating the summer by already &lsquo;tasting the liquor&rsquo; that has not yet been brewed. It seems like she is imagining the exquisite taste of the liquor that is to be made after it was harvested in the summer. This is reinforced by the persona saying &lsquo;Not all the Vats upon the Rhine / Yield such an Alcohol&rdquo; where she shows that this liquor that she will have is richer and more tasteful than the best there is since the valleys of the Rhine is where the best wine come from.
Secondly, these lines and the paradox in both the title and the first line hints at the purity of this liquor coming only from nature. Since brewing is the process to make liquor, how could it exist if it wasn&rsquo;t brewed? Tying this to the idea that brewing is a human action and the spattering of nature imagery and allusions to the heavens in the poem, perhaps the author is telling us that this liquor comes entirely from nature. This makes its purity and perfection a contrast to the persona, exhibiting human traits and reacting to the effects of this liquor.
The second stanza portrays the persona as a drunkard just staggering through the moment she waited for all through spring. The words &ldquo;Inebriate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Debauchee&rdquo;, despite giving a sense of indulgence show that the persona does not really enjoy her liquor. The line &ldquo;reeling -- thro endless summer days&rdquo; does not only show that it is summer and the time for harvest but also that she has succumbed to a certain stupor brought about by this liquor.It may be because the persona has not have enough of this liquor portrayed through her &ldquo;breathing in the air&rdquo; and &ldquo;dew&rdquo; and in the last line of the third stanza where she &ldquo;shall but drink more&rdquo;. These lead us to the conclusion that the persona is hooked on her drink and her life becomes one that just hopes to drink more.
Autumn, shown by the bee, a symbolism of summer, leaving the foxglove which is a flower that blooms in the fall. At the same time, this contrast of summer and autumn also alludes to something graver that happens to the persona. Summer is associated with bliss and freedom but autumn however is a graver season because it is here that one prepares for the upcoming winter. In the poem, this alludes to how the persona transitions from being blissful in the summer to developing health problems and getting poisoned in the autumn as symbolized by the poisonous Foxglove. The last line of the stanza &ldquo;I shall but drink more!&rdquo; serves to show that the persona has become addicted to the liquor, and to an extent, nature. At the same time, the line serves as a resolution that the reader will drink until all nature will be finished, and this is when winter comes along.
The last stanza is all about the fate of our Debauchee and her hopes for the next year. Winter is the last season of the year and it is the last stage in the persona&rsquo;s transition. It also concludes the author&rsquo;s message. Here we see the persona completing her transformation becoming a &ldquo;little Tippler&rdquo;. She is now completely hooked to the products of nature, yet at the same time has no liquor anymore to consume. This is seen through imagery of the last line of the poem &ldquo;Leaning against the -- Sun --&rdquo;. Leaning, in the context of the poem shows her drunk and perhaps hungover. Because of her staggering through the seasons, she ends up looking for support and ironically finds the &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; which is a symbolism hope and a new life. The imageries here and in the poem build to the conclusion that despite the abuse of nature represented by the liquor and the effect it has on us, eventually, we still will turn to it for a new beginning. This is the characteristic of the purity of nature, to be always there for man and it becomes the characteristic of the flaws of man to never be satisfied with what nature gives. All these is tied through the seasons, first on how spring is the time of new hope until winter the time of death, waiting again for a new beginning.

Do a ""close reading"" of the poem, in a short essay of approximately 500 words.
In this poem, O'Hara compares the painting process to the writing process.The painter starts his painting with a concept that is later abandonned for other things the painter sees more fit. Though in the end of the poem, the original name remains, the image has been changed entirely.But O'Hara doesn't approach his art in the same way. Though he hasn't ""mentioned orange yet"", he doesn't lose sight of his theme. Hashing out words for twelve poems, he still manages to capture the essense of what he first wanted to say. He can use a simple word or object to inspire him to describe a wide array of life experiences and emotions.

31030,1348686707,"Good point.  I think it is inevitable that everyone interprets a poem in light of their own education, experience, bias, etc.  I think the liquor metaphor is successful in that Emily portrays herself as an alcoholic in the sense that she just cannot get enough.  But the liquor is just a metaphor.  She's not actually getting drunk.  Having said that, I wonder if Emily thought the metaphor all the way through when she chose it.  It is true, the ultimate result of over-indulgence is the nasty hangover.  ",2

So, they would have been looking down in judgment.  Someone in this thread claimed that Dickinson was a religious person, however she was brought up in a harshly fundamental home with a very authoritarian father. She had serious doubts about God and religion and wrote many poems expressing these doubts.  Those poems are like some kind of debate with God and questions of life's meaning and death.  She was not a true believer, but a seeker.",2

I think that in a very brief essay, you achieve a great deal. I love the opening quote, although I am not quite sure of how this is used as a means to state that the ' ""I"" in the poem is not a person, but a soul.' If it were expanded upon, the relationship might be more clear. Despite this, I think there is definitely something in the statement that the poem is about a soul. I think this could be further explored. I like that you take the conceit of liquor and create the imagery of a brewery using Air, Dew and Molten Blue. This is an interesting perspective on Dickinson's use of these words, but again, there is so much to this poem, that conceit could be explored a little more in depth.&nbsp;
It is interesting that you pay special attention to the Foxglove and its use in making a drug. That, I'm sure, is a little known fact, and I love how you relate it to physical frailty. Maybe this frailty could also be further explored as well, especially in relation to the rest of the poem. Why would Dickinson be talking about physical frailty amidst this poem that seems to be teeming with joy (in the form of drunkenness)? This is definitely worth a deeper look.
The use of punctuation - the dashes and exclamation points - is completely ignored. I think that those are important aspects of the poem that could be very revealing. Also, the stanzaic form was neglected. Further examination of Dickinson's form in the poem could be interesting and give greater insight into this work.
In summary, as I first noted, this essay achieves a great deal, despite its brevity. I do believe, however, that many aspects of the poem were overlooked, and that it could be interesting to further explore some of the above elements, in order to gain a greater understanding of this poem.

1.There is some discussion of a few lines, but is generally a paraphrase.&nbsp;
2. There is no mention of dashes in this essay.
3. There is no mention of stanzaic form.
4. There is a mention of a story, so to speak. The author mentions Emily and her intoxication.&nbsp;
5. There is discussion of the shifting of thought in the poem from physical, mental and spiritual discussion, but the shifting metaphor is not specifically mentioned.&nbsp;
Overall, the personal interaction with the poem and poet was great. However, I would have been curious as to the authors perspective on the use of form and also maybe a discussion of other possible meanings to Emily's metaphor.
