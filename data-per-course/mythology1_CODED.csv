I think the exercise is very much in the writing of a short essay and learning to be succinct in a short word count and then in the marking of other peoples essays we each have to read five essays which of course assists our learning, Whatever our grading for our work makes no difference it is the knowledge that we gain from the exercise that is important. 2,500 words is not going to take as long as 5000!!!",3

These lies are backed up by Telemachus and Eurycleia after they discover Odysseus is home.&nbsp; His rags and physical transformation hide his real identity until it can safely be revealed. Penelope, suspicious of who this man really is, manipulates him into defending the origin of their bed.&nbsp; Odysseus and his companions deceive the Ithacans after he slays the suitors, hoodwinking them into believing that there is a palace wedding celebration.&nbsp; Even old Laertes is deceived by his sonâ€™s lies.&nbsp;Throughout the Odyssey, the gods intervene --- for good or evil.&nbsp; Poseidon's power poses threats and delays.&nbsp; Athena appears in various forms to protect and rescue Odysseus. &nbsp;It is Athena and Zeus who supply the means for a satisfying conclusion to the story. In Book 24, following Zeusâ€™ instructions, Athena guides Odysseus' escape to Laertesâ€™ farm and restores the physicality of both Odysseus and Laertes. &nbsp; Ending the story, Zeus issues a decree via Athena, which is obeyed, henceforth, by Odysseus and the Ithacans:&nbsp; a pact is sealed; memories of the conflict are purged; &nbsp;peace, friendship and wealth crest through the land.

I'm seeing a young man, facing 108 mocking suitors who are threatening both him and his father, should Odysseus return. I really tried to picture the situation, and for me, Telemachus is doing all he can--so even though the source I mention above may be scaled down, it's point is well taken; the SUITORS were like a disease. I just discovered that source http://www.maicar.com/GML&nbsp;in the Resources section of our Course Wiki, which has SO much information!Book 1: l. 445 refers to ""cool-headed Telemachus"", who amazes the suitors with his daring in standing up to them.Book 2: In the scene with the Ithacan assembly, l. 143 says ""with calm good sense, Telemachus replied...""l. 231, ""Telemachus answered, firm in his resolve.."" to follow Athena's direction about visiting Nestor and Menelaus. He says that, after a year, if he has not discovered what has happened to Odysseus, he will return and Penelope can marry.Mentor then supports Telemachus and rightfully points out that the problem lies with the suitors, ""weaving their violent work with all their wicked hearts."" l. 264. Mentor holds the assembly responsible for allowing the suitors to become an unruly mob--and of course is mocked by the suitors while the assembly stays quiet. l. 343 describes him as ""self-possessed Telemachus"" even though the suitors are mocking both him and Mentor.

It comes from the ""grey area"".Since I'm someone who tries to avoid seeing things as ""black or white"", I sort of dwell in the grey. This idea that the binary pair is based on biology makes the human brain sound like a computer to me. When he ended by saying that Structuralism says there is ONE&nbsp;binary pair at the core of each myth, I had to stop. To go ""binary hunting"", for me, would be to take the joy out of reading.

She's a good match for Odysseus in her intelligence and cleverness; I like her cautious approach to this ""stranger"" in her house. And her grief over Odysseus is woven throughout the last chapters--even after 20 years, she has been loyal to him.In fact, I was touched by the several places where she begs Artemis to kill her with an arrow--just so she can be free of the grief in the first case, and so she won't have to marry one of the suitors in the other. But, like Odysseus when he contemplates suicide, she pulls herself together and carries on. The scene with the two of them by their bed made them so very human--testing each other out, and then finally reaching acceptance. 20 years! What a woman, unlike any other in the book.

3975,1370033568,"Thank you, [REDACTED], for bringing over your essay to
this thread so that we may expand our discussion on Functionalism.

Somewhere in the beginning of the essay, you may
have to say that you are using a Functionalist tool to consider the
relationship between the gods and the Greeks of Homeric times. Otherwise, to an
objective observer, the essay may sound like it is just describing the godsâ€™
behavior and the consequences of obeying/not obeying them.

You may also wish to consider these aspects:

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinarily,
cattle were considered the best meat to eat, in terms of value and taste (to
those who eat meat). However, Heliosâ€™ cattle had been made sacred and so it is
a â€˜food crimeâ€™ to eat it. Odysseusâ€™ men had broken a sacrament. They had
offended the gods by breaking what may be considered the No. 1 Taboo of their
time.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
menâ€™s behavior also seemed flippant towards the gods. They ostensibly swore an
oath not to eat the cattle and immediately reversed position on it. They tried
to justify their actions by making token sacrifices/libations to the gods but
they did not seem sincere and did not make a greater effort to make the proper
offerings. Remember how Menelaus also suffered for not making proper
sacrifices.

All things said, your essay is quite well-written. The descriptions are very good, with judicious quotes from the book to back up your position. I am
curious to know, however, if your reviewers may have asked you to give more of
an analysis of how Functionalism works in this episode.&nbsp;",2

4019,1370149204,"Here is my essay in answer to question #3 on Structuralism. I had to pare down the introduction and conclusion considerably&nbsp; to make the word limit at exactly 550 words.Binary Opposition Expressed in the Arrival of Odysseus at Scheria
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structural analysis consists of searching for details in the 
narrative of a myth that represent one aspect or another of a core 
cultural binary pair. In The Odyssey, book 5 (Fagles, 165-166),
 a naked Odysseus seeks shelter for the night after landing on the shore
 of Scheria. After setting out for the woods, Odysseus ""found a grove...
 beneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root, one olive wild, the
 other well-bred stock"" (Fagles, 167). The binary opposition revealed 
here is wild or primitive versus cultivated or civilized,
 a distinction basic to human culture. Only civilized cultures can 
produce cultivated crops and manufactured shelters. The olive tree of well-bred stock is an indication that the naked and starving, seemingly primitive, Odysseus has arrived in a land of civilized people.
Odysseus then crept beneath the bushes, ""scraping up at once a good 
wide bed for himself with both hands"" (Fagles, 167). He used his hands because he lacked the tools,
 the sign of a civilized man. Then, ""A fine litter of dead leaves had 
drifted in,"" meaning that he took advantage of the leaves drifting in rather than using tools
 like a rake or broom. Later, in book 23, Odysseus boasts of having made
 the bed in his own home with tools such the adze, auger and plumb line 
(Fagles, 462). This shows the contrast between Odysseus in his civilized
 prime and the primitive state to which he had been reduced when landing
 on Scheria.
Next morning (book 6) when Odysseus meets Nausicaa and her maids, he 
stripped ""a leafy branch from the tangled olive growth to shield his 
body, hide his private parts"" (Fagles, 172). He felt the embarrassment 
of a civilized man being naked in society, but he had to use the wild covering of a branch rather than a manufactured garment.
The distinction between wild and civilized continues (page 172) with 
this comparison of Odysseus to an animal who preys, not only on other 
wild animals, but also on flocks and homesteads, the products of 
civilization:

&nbsp;... And out he stalked
as&nbsp; a mountain lion exultant in his power
strides through wind and rain and his eyes blaze
and he charges sheep or oxen or chases wild deer
but his hunger drives him on to go for flocks,
even to raid the best-defended homestead.

The reference to the ""best-defended homestead"" may be pointing ahead&nbsp;
 to his future destruction of the suitors, during which he has to act 
with animalistic violence.
Nausicaa's answer to Odysseus' introduction is to welcome him to 
civilized society and offer him clothing: ""But now, seeing you've 
reached our city and our land, you'll never lack for clothing..."" 
(Fagles, 174). She mentions clothing even before she offers him food. 
The handmaidens lay out a cloak and shirt for him and a flask of olive 
oil, a product of the cultivated olive tree, to rub on his skin. When he
 appears to Nausicaa fully bathed and clothed she responds (p 176), ""now
 he seems like a god who rules the skies up there!... give the stranger 
food and drink, my girls."" Only when Odysseus appears presentable can he
 be accepted into civilized society and be given food and drink.",2

856,1367058983,"Hello [REDACTED]. I'm glad you asked that question. I believe things are a bit more complicated.Let's start with the baby Astyanax. The only reason he was killed was because the Achaeans knew that when he grew up he would seek revenge, and this way they prevented that. I'm not justifying the act, just explaining the reasoning. It was one of those cruel war-acts that had to be done.As for Sparta, they never killed sick babies. On the contrary, they grew up to become citizens. In fact, one of kings of Sparta, Agisilaos, was born with one leg disformed, but that didn't stop the Spartans for having him as a king. Also, there is a very nice story about a Spartan soldier who was getting ready to fight alongside the other Spartans, but the others were making fun of him and told him he couldn't fight since he didn't have legs. To that he answered: ""you only need legs if you are going to abandon the battle"". Another soldier was blind and when the others told him not to fight he answered ""if I'm in the battlefield, even if I don't do anything there is always the possibility that my knife will find the enemy"".These stories show that the killing of sick children was a fairy-tale and never really happened. But more importantly, archaeological excavations of the area have only found bones that belong to adults, probably enemies or criminals sentenced to death. No trace of infands or children being killed in Sparta.",2

3751,1369699698,"Dear [REDACTED],I'm not sure this will answer your question, but I wanted to expand the idea of misogyny a bit. There are several ways to understand Hesiod's positioning of women in his text: we might return to the generations of the gods, where in the first generation Gaia gives birth on her own, and, in the last generation, Zeus gives birth to Athena, and she takes the side of men from then onwards (we'll see this in Aeschylus' ""Furies""). One of the fears at the basis of these myths is the fear of a father that his child is not actually his: without DNA testing, how can you know for sure? If a woman stays in the house, she depletes all the man's goods; if she goes out of the house, how do we know she stays faithful? We get the story of Pandora, who opens her jar of evils, and hope alone is left inside. We might read the jar as a metaphorical womb, and the hope as the hope of legitimate children... but maybe that is going too far. What is interesting to me is that, without two parents in the generations of gods, there is no strife; with two parents comes rivalry and fighting and usurpation of power, eventually, Zeus claiming his patrimony as king of the gods, and putting an end to the fighting. So, is it misogynistic? Or an exploration of fears about fatherhood? Or fears about losing control? Happy to talk about Hesiod and women on Thursday, but I'm curious to expand the argument and maybe get into the hymns as well...",2

I would hope that Awe is still a basic part of what it means to be human--but I'm wondering if the harnessing of technology has led to some hubris on the part of ""advanced"" humanity. The professor defined Awe as ""fear plus wonder""--but what happens in a society that tries to avoid fear as much as possible? Or tames that fear by putting it onto movie screens where the fear is just vicarious, not visceral?I've just posted a thread in the Homer forum for works inspired by THE ODYSSEY, and my first entry is the poem ""Ulysses"" by Tennyson. The last lines of the poem show the need to face the fear of the unknown up through the end of our lives.

3738,1369686254,"I would appreciate your feedback as I am disappointed with my evaluations.The question I have chosen is number three; â€œPropose an answer to the question of what binary opposition lies underneath this part of the story and provides the best insight into what is really at stake in it.â€ The question is based upon structuralist binaries. The structuralist method of analyzing literature is accomplished by contrasting the binary or two opposites of written pieces typically using the most rudimentary parts of the human experience. Examples would be two men; where one is hot and the other is cold or one is thin and the other is fat. In my structural analysis I understand I need look for repetitions, patterns, echoes, and oppositions in people, places, language, objects, movement, and decisions.The answer to the posed question of what binary opposition lies underneath this part of the story and provides the best insight into what is really at stake in it. Odysseus and the Cyclops are in binary opposition to one another and their contrasting differences lie beneath the book&nbsp;The Odyssey, Book 9&nbsp;story titled:&nbsp;In the One-eyed Giants Cave.&nbsp;The following&nbsp;binarystructural analysis attempts show the implications of repetitions and oppositions by exploring the relationships of similarity and difference that link the storyâ€™s events and the actions of Odysseus and Cyclops..Odysseus and the Cyclops are both ruthless men but opposites; Odysseus is smooth, cunning and quick and the Cyclops rough, oafish, and plodding.&nbsp; Odysseus is a liar saying â€œsince we chanced on youâ€. Odysseus â€œchancedâ€ upon no one having knowingly sailed up to what he knew to be Cyclopsâ€™s island, anchored, and marched ashore looking for food. Odysseus was plotting to steal the Cyclopsâ€™s food: â€œLetâ€™s make away with the cheeses, then come backâ€ at the same time asking the Cyclops for Xenia or hospitality saying â€œweâ€™re at your knees, in hopes of a warm welcomeâ€. &nbsp;The Cyclops grumbles; â€œWe Cyclops never blink at Zeusâ€ and â€œIâ€™d never spare you in fear of Zeusâ€™s hatredâ€. The Cyclops having no reply from Odysseus the â€œruthless bruteâ€ snatches two of Odysseusâ€™s men and eats them. Odysseus continues to lie to the Cyclops by responding â€œSo, you ask me the name I am known by, Cyclops?â€ Odysseus says in answer to his rhetorical question: â€œNobody----thatâ€™s my nameâ€. The Cyclops â€œboomed back from his ruthless heartâ€ â€œNobody? Iâ€™ll eat Nobody last of all his friendsâ€Finally to conclude with the textâ€™s function, not its meaning, as the text's function is its meaning. The function of the text is to contrast the two opponentâ€™s styles, Odysseus and Cyclops, both of whom are very dangerous individuals. To make their escape Odysseus is perfectly willing to lie even badger Cyclops getting him drunk to put his eye out. Cyclops responds the only way he understands with brute force and outrageous cannibalistic behavior. The textâ€™s function is to show Odysseus triumphant over Cyclops as good, (maybe not too good), over evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cites:Bedford Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms, StructuralismBedford Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms,&nbsp;Claude LÃ©vi-StraussIn Odyssey book 9, Odysseus explains â€œsince we chanced youâ€ (Fagles, 219)In Odyssey book 9, Odysseus relates: &nbsp;â€œLetâ€™s make away with the cheesesâ€ (Fagles, 218)In Odyssey book 9, Odysseus explains â€œweâ€™re at your knees, in hopes of a warm welcomeâ€ (Fagles, 219)In Odyssey book 9, Odysseus explains â€œWe Cyclops never blinkâ€ (Fagles, 220).In Odyssey book 9, Odysseus explains â€œNobodyâ€ (Fagles, 223).",2

Telemachus DID try to get rid of them with the Ithacan assembly, but even with his father's friend Mentor speaking out against the relatives of the suitors. These egotistical young men, ""the pride of Ithacan nobility"", did as they pleased right in front of not only their parents but the Ithacan assembly! And what they pleased was not only to harrass Penelope but plot to kill Odysseus if he SHOULD return, and even take the life of Telemachus. This is bullying to the nth degree, with no one supporting Penelope and Telemachus. http://www.maicar.com/GML/SUITORSPENELOPE.htmlThe SUITORS were like a disease 
Now, the reasonable way was for the SUITORS to be off, each to 
his own place, and conduct the suit from their own homes. And that is why Telemachus proposed them to feast themselves 
elsewhere, giving them formal notice to quit his palace in front of the Ithacan 
assembly. For Telemachus saw these young men who 
pestered his mother with unwanted attentions and wasted his wealth as a disease 
and an outrage to decency. But the SUITORS, who were the pride of Ithacan 
nobility, could not see any wrong in courting the widow of a dead king. And it 
was her, they argued, who had forced them to act as they did. For she had fooled 
them during three years with The Shroud of Laertes, saying that she would marry 
once she had finished this piece of work. But she, deceiving everybody, 
unravelled by night what she wove by day, and so, they reasoned, in order to 
avoid to be fooled again, they would have to stay and undermine the palace's 
finances until she decided to abandon her reluctant attitude. These were the 
means by which the SUITORS expected to force Penelope to make a choice, and by letting Telemachus suffer and see his wealth consumed, they 
hoped that he would persuade his mother to marry one of them....

And that is why Odysseus' old friend 
Mentor did not pick a quarrel at the 
Ithacan assembly with these unexperienced youths, but instead he admonished the 
citizens of Ithaca and the SUITORS' relatives for their acquiescent attitude. 
...And since nobody among those who counted for the 
SUITORS, condemned or admonished them, they dared to push their luck even 
further, declaring that if Odysseus would suddenly 
appear he would meet an ugly end, which means that from thoughtless SUITORS they 
were turning into rebels and instigators of rebellion.&nbsp;... And once the SUITORS started thinking 
this last thought, it was not difficult for them to go even further and plot, 
although in vain, against the life of Telemachus,""

528,1366816824,"In the Geneology of Morals, Nietzsche has a section on this
worth quoting at length:

â€œâ€¦

That the conception of the gods in itself need not lead to the degradation of the imagination that
we had to consider briefly, that there are nobler
uses for the invention of the gods than for the self-crucifixion and &nbsp;self-violation of man in which Europe over the
past millennia achieved its distinctive mastery- that is fortunately revealed
even by a mere glance at the Greek gods,
those reflections of noble and autocratic men, in whom the animal in man felt deified and &nbsp;did not lacerate
itself, &nbsp;did not rage against itself! For the longest time these Greeks used
their gods precisely so as to ward off the â€˜bad conscienceâ€™, so as to be able
to rejoice in their freedom of soul- the very opposite of the use to which
Christianity put its God. They went very
far in this direction, these splendid and lion-hearted children; and no
less an authority than the Homeric Zeus himself occasionally gives them to
understand that they are making things too easy for themselves. â€˜â€™Strange!â€ he
says once- the case is that of Aegisthus, a very
bad case-

Strange how these
morals so loudly complain of the gods!

We along produce evil,
they say; yet themselves

Make themselves
wretches through folly, even counter to fate. 

Yet one can see and hear how even this Olympian spectator
and judge is far from holding a grudge against them or thinking ill of them on
that account: â€˜how foolish they are!â€™
he thinks when he observes the misdeeds of mortals- and â€˜foolishnessâ€™, â€˜follyâ€™,
a little&nbsp; â€˜disturbance in the head,â€™ this
much even the Greeks of the strongest, bravest age conceded of themselves as
the reason for much that was bad and calamitous- foolishness, not sin! Do you grasp that?

Even this disturbance in the head, however, presented a
problem: â€˜how is it possible? How could it actually have happened to heads such
as we have, we men of aristocratic
descent, of the best society, happy, well-constituted, noble, and virtuous?â€™-
thus noble Greeks asked themselves for centuries in the face of every
incomprehensible atrocity or wantonness with which one of their kind had
polluted himself. â€˜He must have been deluded by a god â€™ the concluded finally, shaking their headsâ€¦This expedient is typical of the Greeksâ€¦In this way the
gods served in those days to justify man to a certain extent even in his wickedness,
they served as the originators of evil- in those days they took upon
themselves, not the punishment but, what is nobler,
the guilt.""",2

Odysseus fights for his life, suffers pain and heartsickness, and watches all his comrades die.  Odysseusâ€™ family suffers hardship as well:  Odysseusâ€™ son has a â€œheart obsessed with griefâ€ (Fagles, 81); Odysseusâ€™ wife is full of â€œunforgettable griefâ€ (Fagles, 88); His mother â€œdied of griefâ€ and; His father has a â€œheart racked with sorrowâ€ (Fagles 330).  Odysseus, and everyone he cares about, is negatively affected.

In addition to emotional tolls, Odysseusâ€™ property is depleted by suitors who overtake his house and court his wife in his absence (Fagles, 85).  By Book 5, Odysseus literally loses everything, except life, when he barely escapes a shipwreck, washing up on the island of Phaeacia (Fagles, 166).  Odysseus is completely alone, naked, and in need of everything to survive (Fagles, 174).  Accordingly, it is no coincidence that Odysseusâ€™ final stop introduces him to a peaceful society, thriving without war.

Through Phaeacia, Homer proposes another way to live.  Odysseus is told: â€œPhaeacians... care nothing for bow or quiverâ€ (Fagles, 176).  Unlike Odysseus, a master with weaponry (Fagles, 427),  Phaeacians donâ€™t use weapons.  This is also a place flourishing with a burgeoning city center, water resources, endless crops and plant life.  Odysseus observes: â€œTreesâ€¦ always in prime, pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red, succulent figs and olives swellingâ€¦ harvest all year roundâ€¦. a teeming vineyardâ€¦ greens of every kindâ€¦two springsâ€¦balanced shipsâ€¦meeting groundsâ€¦â€ (Fagles, 183).  If war represents death and destruction, then everything about Phaeacia represents life and creation.  Odysseus sees that a society which rejects war is superior.

Finally, in Book 24, Homer gives his protagonist an opportunity to apply what he has learned from his experiences. After Odysseus kills the suitors, their families swear revenge (Fagles, 481).  Odysseus prepares for war again, when Athena, Odysseusâ€™ guide, asks him to reconsider. She urges: â€œHold back now! Call a halt to the great leveler, Warâ€ (Fagles, 485).  After all he has gone through, Odysseus chooses not to fight.  Homer imparts: â€œHe obeyed her, glad at heart.  And Athena handed down her pacts of peace between both sides for all the years to comeâ€ (Fagles, 485).  By choosing not to battle, Odysseus and Ithaca are rewarded.

Since previous books discuss repercussions of war and Book 24 brings peace, it concludes Homerâ€™s anti-war sentiments and provides evidence this was Homerâ€™s intended ending for his epic.  He used his poetry to make is views of war known and to advocate for diplomacy and peace.

1514,1367600067,"[REDACTED]: I personally can't talk to the claim that there where no priestly group in Ancient Greece. I'm sure Prof. [REDACTED] has his reasons for saying this, but it could be that it's a simplification of saying that there where priests and priestesses, but they&nbsp;didn't have much power in society (like they did in other parts of the world).&nbsp;My source also talks about that being the general understanding, but she raises the question&nbsp;if we should reconsider this notion, seeing how highly valued parts of meat&nbsp;and what quantities&nbsp;they got.







""That the priests and priestesses were given such quantities of meat is somewhat surprising. Greek religious personnel did not occupy a particularly prominent position within Greek cult, if compared with priesthoods in other cultures and periods. The presence of a priest of priestess was not even required at a sacrifice within a sanctuary and, in contrast to Near Eastern practice, for example, it was the group and not the priest who made the offerings to the gods. Greek priests did not form priestly colleges like their Roman counterparts, and they had not distinct codifying power over ritual, or any political influence. In fact, one of the characteristics of Greek priesthoods has been defined as their lack of power and influence. However, the fact that they did receive so much meat, including the parts given to the gods, should perhaps lead us to reconsider the notion of Greek priests and priestesses as not occupying a particularly prominent position. If we look upon Greek priest and priestesses from the point of view of meat distribution, and this is not an insignificant perspective in this context, they were of great importance and held high status. It is possible that we may not yet have fully grasped the significance of priest and priestesses in Greek religion.""

Sorry, but as an educator, I stick with the idea that plagiarism is stealing and cheating.&nbsp;Plain and simple. What I agree with is that WE shouldn't be the ones to assess an essay suspected of being plagiarized. That's the job of the professor and the TA's. So I'm not sure how that can be reported--but to treat a plagiarized essay the same way others are treated--people who really DID their work--is simply not right.This thread--with people I really respect and admire--has definitely made up my mind NOT to do the second essay. If plagiarism is allowed simply because ""it doesn't matter"", then I will not participate in a peer response system that lets stealing and cheating slide.I'm sick at heart that this has ALREADY come up--and for me, the issue is the whole ""grading"" business. I'm NOT going to repeat all the lengthy discussions we had in F&amp;SF. However,&nbsp;I still maintain that our essay threads--where people simply posted their essays for responses--were a wonderful way to share ideas. We could read the work of many more than five students, and simply offer comments. [REDACTED], everyone has to make their own decision, but I disagree with one comment you make: ""After all, no kittens will be harmed by someone submitting a plagiarised essay for an online course."" True, thank heaven. However, when I caught a straight ""A"" student plagiarizing in his senior year and reported it, he was suspended for 3 days and lost his grade point average. I'll never forget that he came and thanked me for showing him what integrity meant. I had been heartsick--but his reponse has guided me ever since. ",4

1356,1367446805,"I am always so curious about the contradiction that men in these older times/stories seem to put women on a pedestal and yet treat them like property and without any rights? Throughout the Odyssey we see lots of helpful, positive female characters. Penelope is faithful to Odysseus and wont remarry. She is cunning in her weaving and unweaving of her endless web. Helen is beautiful, magical, has the ability to take away pain with her potions and is a good hostess and entertainer. Calypso lives in a natural world, she exemplifies sex, passion, love, youth, beauty, vitality.  And while told by the Gods to let Odysseus go against her will she is essential in helping him leave by pointing out the best trees and giving him tools to build his raft. Then we have Nausicaa who is young, beautiful, a virgin, obediently washing everyone&#39;s clothes doing her duty who  will assist Odysseus as well. Lets not forget Athena, Odysseus&#39; savior who master minds every step of his safe return home and acts as a guide home. There are &quot;great&quot; women everywhere and they are almost all described as beautiful. Perhaps Homer was a ladies&#39; man? Women help the male heroes of our story at every turn. And Odysseus suggests he wants men and women to coexist happily. 
p. 174 &quot;No, finer, greater gift in the world than that...when man and woman possess their home, two minds, two hearts that work as one.&quot;
But do we really see scenarios where men and women are on the same page? where women have equal footing? It seems they have duties, roles, support men. Penelope&#39;s husband is gone and the suitors plague her. Theres also talk of sending her back to her father. Her home isnt her own. Calypso loves Odysseus. He sleeps with her but he doesnt love her back. Helen tries to leave Menelaus for Paris and he launches a war to get her back bc she&#39;s his. 
Anyways, Im not sure what the ultimate conclusion is here. Just some things Im mulling over.",2

 [REDACTED]...YIKES!
I think the problem with both of these questions, 1 &amp; 2,
arises as a result of poor test design. I answered the questions correctly, but
didn't feel all that good about being correct in my choices. Why? Well, because
there was a smidgen of guessing in my choices.

Q1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;
""...viewed myth as a precursor to more advanced forms of thought, like science.
He viewed it as driven by irrational fears.""


Heyne &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;
â€œâ€¦human beings now are put in a position, when they create myth are being in a
state of both fear but also wonder at the world around them. So for him, myth
is not just fear-based irrationalityâ€¦â€&nbsp;

Fontenelle &nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;
â€œâ€¦ancient humans develop some explanation. And when they were in fear of the
world around them or found strange the world around themâ€¦â€ andâ€¦ â€œ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
-&gt;&nbsp; â€œThey tried to do science to explain the world but they're working from a
very limited data setâ€¦â€ andâ€¦



&nbsp;â€œ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;
â€œMyth is an attempt at science and it's best seen as kind of proto science or a
bad science.â€&nbsp;

Hume&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; â€œOur rational minds are finally leaving
[myth] behind. We're casting it aside and developing new scientific ways of
thinking. [* I think this is the reference which addresses the question]



â€œ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; â€œIt [myth] was thought to be the
result of fearful human beings making up stories in a way that was comforting
to them.â€



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -------------------------------------------------





Q2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp; ""What is considered the
â€œmodern eraâ€ in this course?""


L1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; &nbsp; ""...anything
in the modern era counts as Renaissance and forward for our course.""&nbsp;

A2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;
""anything after the middle ages""



Upon review, I think that's the issue and the place where things become a
little murky, because of course the Renaissance came after the middle ages, but
that is not the way it was defined in lecture 1.4.&nbsp;

In any event, these are small points in the overall context
of this wonderful course. However, I do have to wonder and possibly even
proceed with a bit of trepidation when I consider what are likely to be the
more complex question-sets we are likely to encounter in the weeks ahead.&nbsp;

Again, thank you very much for responding to my query and
for helping me to think it through.



Best,
