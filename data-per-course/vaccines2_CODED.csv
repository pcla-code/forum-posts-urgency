I know this is sort of off topic for this week, but not really (there's just no ""General Comments/Issues"" forum to put it in).I'm a big, longtime Law &amp; Order SVU fan here (ha ha, I'm [REDACTED]..) and this past week's new episode focused on the issue of vaccinations and the anti-vaxx movement.

In the US, often when vaccines are not recommended, they are not covered by insurance, they are not discussed by providers and pubic health agencies do not have resources to educate about them. So, as we do the math and conclude that shingles vaccine might not be a good public health investment using public dollars, what would be the solution for getting people to know about the vaccine and its availability? 1) We have heard that some people can't afford it, 2) we know that shingles pain can be so severe that people consider suicide, and 3) we will set the stage for a two-tiered system whereby people that can afford it, get it and those who can't afford it, can't.The same may be true of the new meningococcal type B vaccine where the CDC's advisory committee only recommended the vaccine for high risk groups because of the cost-benefit analysis. They will revisit the general recommendation question in June.Then, there is the HPV-9 vaccine not given preference over the HPV-2 and -4 versions even though it can protect more people from cancer.It used to be that the CDC's recommendations were based on what is best for the public's health and state laws were often where the cost/resources questions were determined. More recently cost-benefit analyses became part of the ACIP charter. So, where does that leave us for making sure that we don't have to tell parents their child could have been saved from a meningococcal type B vaccine that is available? their grandparent could still be self-sufficient if he/she had the shingles vaccine to prevent their current case of shingles? and their spouse would still be here to help raise their children if he/she had had the 9-valent HPV vaccine instead of the one the office happened to have in stock?We recently published an article about this in our newsletter for healthcare providers; part 2 will be published in May:http://vec.chop.edu/professionals/vaccine-healthcare-providers/news-views/#acip-changesI look forward to hearing some ideas/potential solutions.

The data shows that by far mass quarantine was the most effective strategy at eradicating small pox and even studies in the NIH state the small pox was a disease that more than likely would have eradicated itself. If you look at the small pox statistics in both Britain and the U.S both prior to and after the implementation of the small pox vaccine you'll see that rates of infection were higher in vaccinated areas and one was more likely to die from small pox if they contracted it and had been vaccinated. Why do you think the ""anti-vaccine"" movement started after the small pox vaccine was implemented? It killed and severely disabled people. *You should also consider how the diagnostic criteria changed after the implementation of the small pox vaccine.C. The diagnostic criteria for polio changed after the licensure of the polio vaccine to make it look more effective. What is now aseptic meningitis was non-paralytic polio. Coxsackie, DDT, arsenic, and lead poisoning, GBS, enteroviruses, and any other disease that could yield paralysis for 24 hours or more was automatically given the diagnosis of polio prior to the vaccine. For almost 30 years the only cases of paralytic polio in this country were caused by OPV and it is still paralyzing people all over the world. And let's not forget the Cutter incident and SV40 - which presented their own problems, as well as how polio actually thrives and spreads.D. Flu shots do not work.

He's got so many food allergies and asthma to boot; these things do not run in the family. As with the gelatin case in Japan, I think his peanut allergy could be due to the HIB vaccine which uses peanut oil (albeit refined. Hard to say anymore since FDA GRAS ingredients don't need to be listed on vaccine inserts).I waver back and forth - do I risk DS getting bacterial meningitis (side note: my generation never had the HIB vaccine growing up), which I hope and understand to be extremely unlikely (AND, he's had all of his prior HIB vaccines), or do I risk DS having a deeply entrenched peanut allergy that causes him to carry around two epi-pens and a constant risk of anaphylaxis for the rest of his life (assuming this is not yet the case, but we are working with a pediatric allergist)?

It should be said also that in ovo/day 1 vaccination has been promoted for economical reason, but may not be the best way to acquire strong immunity (leading to insufficient immunity, inapparent infection..).

My children, as well as we, their parents have been vaccinated, according to the official schedule in our respective countries. What happens is we want to be informed and we like to think that critical thinking is better than just accumulating information, although it cannot happen without the latter.In this course we hear a lot about numerous studies that have been performed by the pharmaceuticals in order to prove the medical safety of the vaccines, some of them being cited in the bottom of the slide, something I celebrate (there is nothing vaguer than ""a lot of important scientists""). Yesterday I did a random search for both ethylmercury and methylmercury, wanting to get better acquainted with both (I am an architect, not anything related to the health sphere or chemical/biological sciences). I accidentally ran into a site that took me to this reccord of the Congress here. For those too busy to read it all, an important study cited a lot to dissociate any relationship between mercury levels and autism, was proven to be wrong (a statistical mistake, leading to a false interpretation of the numbers, initially reported to be statistically insignificant). My first thought was to oversee it, but then I read the authors (Ip et al.) admitted the mistake and rectified. That made me perform a search for the authors of the reanalysis and they seem to me pretty sound scientists with a solid background. You can find Dr. Catherine Desoto here, a link to her article together with Dr. Hitlan here and, a detailed FAC to the attacks the article received here. The last one is important if people want to get sense of what the article actually concluded and how misinformation is easily spread out.The article has nothing to do with vaccines, but the study it proved wrong was widely used to assure, hence mercury levels have nothing to do with autism, so vaccines dont either.My point is, if this so widely cited study was wrong, how many others out their could be? How would the actual state of knowledge change if all of them were re-examined in detail? I think, usually scientists are busy doing their own research, rather than recalculating the statistical values of fellow-scientists and only something quite incoherent would make them actually do so.

Indeed, the news about rubella comes on the heels of the Americas  successful elimination of smallpox in 1971 and polio in 1994'.'But here in the United States, the MMR shot has also found itself at the center of controversy that has plagued public health officials for the past decade. Thanks to a widely discredited study that incorrectly linked the MMR vaccine to a greater risk of autism, some U.S. parents have grown wary of giving their kids this particular vaccine. Despite all scientific evidence to the contrary, this myth about vaccines has been particularly persistent.'Specifically because of lower MMR vaccination rates among people who are skeptical about vaccine safety, measles has been able to spread more widely'.'Just last week, the results from a massive study of autism rates among toddlers provided the latest proof that the MMR shot has absolutely no relationship with this particular disease. Scientists remain hopeful that the body of evidence about vaccines, which are considered to be one of the greatest public health advances of the 20th century, will ease skeptical parents concerns'.____________________This success simply adds to the millions of other facts supporting universal vaccination. An irrational, unsupported opposition by a minority constitutes a significant public health risk for resurgence of diseases largely eliminated by vaccination.",2.0

1260,1431001924,"Hello [REDACTED] --Let's see if we can turn this discussion into one about vaccines. There is, perhaps, an analogy to be drawn between a vaccine schedule and a class schedule. For the sake of uniformity, it makes sense to have a uniform vaccine schedule by country or province or whatever. When you comply with the schedule for MMR, say, as a prerequisite for child day-care, you are relatively assured that other parents have, too. The rules for administration of a vaccine are uniform, too.Dosage and route are all fixed. Perhaps they are arbitrary, but the insert recommendations apply to all. Is possible to negotiate a personal schedule? Yes. Could the public health system afford to negotiate a personal schedule with everyone? No. So you have rules.Rules suck. I hate rules.I especially hate rules from professors that force me to read instructions and interfere with my social schedule. In my years of life, however, I have learned that they make things more efficient. Ronald Coase won the Nobel Prize for his observation that all rules can be bargained around; but it is cheaper when the rules reflect the reality of the situation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pTZ2oG2Y0cI hate the speed limit on my road. If I got a ticket, my chances of bargaining around the rule would be slim. ""I didn't see any sign,"" I would say. Judge says pay fine. ""The speed limit is too low,"" I would counter. Judge says pay fine. ""This law is unconstitutional,"" I retort. Judge asks if I want to go to jail for contempt.Same with class schedules and grading rules. Sure, you could negotiate with each student, but that would affect the validity of the grade. Same with vaccine schedules. They work best when everyone plays by the same rules.",2.0

1600,1432170456,"Two separate considerations here:1) What is happening immunologically?2) What makes sense programatically?In reference to immunologically: One day before the first birthday is not likely to make a difference to the immune response/protection. The younger child, say around 6 months, you might need to think about interference from maternal antibodies. Generally speaking, during that first year of life, effectiveness of live viral vaccines needs to be considered in relation to the presence of maternal antibodies; however, maternal antibodies vary from mom to mom and, therefore, from infant to infant.In reference to programatically: Particularly because of school entrance laws, there has to be a cut-off. The CDC generally allows for a 4 day grace period; however, state laws and mandates may over-ride this:In clinical practice, vaccine doses occasionally are
administered at intervals less than the minimum interval or at
ages younger than the minimum age. Doses administered too
close together or at too young an age can lead to a suboptimal
immune response. However, administering a dose a few days
earlier the minimum interval or age is unlikely to have a substantially
negative effect on the immune response to that dose.
Vaccine doses administered days before the minimum interval
or age are considered valid; however, local or state mandates
might supersede this 4-day guideline.br />n certain situations, local or state requirements might mandate that doses of
selected vaccines be administered on or after specific ages. For example, a school
entry requirement might not accept a dose of MMR or varicella vaccine administered
before the child first birthday. ACIP recommends that physicians
and other health-care providers comply with local or state vaccination requirements

However, boosters are required quite frequently to maintain protection against rabies long term: the schedule requires an initial three doses, a booster at one year, then further boosters at 3-5 year intervals after that. Even this does not provide full protection, and following contact with an animal suspected of carrying rabies, further doses of vaccine are required to stimulate the immune response. So in this case, prior vaccination won't necessarily be a 'cure' that allows anyone who has been vaccinated to be fully protected from rabies for life.Given also that vaccines are expensive to produce and purchase, may be difficult to store (e.g. require refrigeration/temperature control), and after a few years go out of date, it is not advisable for them to be on a country's vaccine programme if the disease is not present or prevalent there.

So, if Dr. [REDACTED]is going to sit with a Mary Holland-type, it would be more accurate to have a whole stage full of scientists and public health officials sitting with him and the supporters of Mary Holland (or equivalent) to show the relative size of these 2 schools of thought.Someone seeking information about any of the vaccine safety concerns put forth by Mary or others who wants to know Dr. [REDACTED]'s thoughts can find his responses with detailed explanations in a variety of places including books, websites and videos.",4.0

986,1430179280,"Information for context ... this is the information on infectivity (transmission, shedding) from native infection, pandemic H1N1TRANSMISSIONPerson-to-person transmission/span>Influenza viruses can be transmitted through sneezing and coughing via large-particle droplets [31]. In addition to respiratory secretions, certain other bodily fluids (eg, diarrheal stool) should also be considered potentially infectious [32]. In contrast to previous outbreaks of swine influenza viruses described above (see 'Historical perspective' above), the 2009 to 2010 pandemic of H1N1 influenza A infection demonstrated sustained human-to-human transmission, as suggested by the large numbers of patients with respiratory illnesses identified within a short period of time at various locations around the world [33]. Several of the isolates causing disease in the United States were found to be nearly genetically identical to isolates in Mexico, supportive of person-to-person transmission [2,34].Nosocomial transmission was observed between hospitalized patients, between healthcare providers, and from patients to healthcare providers [35,36]. Viral shedding/span>Similar to what has been observed with seasonal influenza, shedding of pandemic H1N1 influenza A was observed to begin the day prior to symptom onset and often to persist for five to seven days or longer in immunocompetent individuals [31,37-40]. Even longer periods of shedding occurred in children (especially young infants), elderly adults, patients with chronic illnesses, and immunocompromised hosts. Delayed clearance of virus from the nasopharynx was observed in patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or who had fatal disease [41]. The amount of virus shed was greatest during the first two to three days of illness.Various findings related to viral shedding were observed among patients infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza A, as illustrated by the following studies:lthough it is thought that immunocompetent patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus infection were likely to be contagious from one day prior to the development of signs and symptoms until resolution of fever, longer periods of shedding were detected in a study of United States air force academy cadets with confirmed or suspected pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection [37]. Of 29 samples that were obtained seven days following illness onset, seven (24 percent) contained viable H1N1 influenza virus.n a study that included 426 patients in China who were quarantined with pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus infection, the average duration of viral shedding was six days based upon real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) [38]. The median interval from resolution of fever to a negative rRT-PCR result was three days, with negative results occurring within seven days in 96 percent of patients. However, PCR techniques detect viral RNA, and not infectious virus, and may continue to be positive after viral cultures become negative.n a study that included 26 individuals (median age eight years) with proven pandemic H1N1 influenza A based upon positive rRT-PCR results during an elementary school-based outbreak in the United States, the median duration of viral shedding from fever onset was six days (range 1 to 13 days) by rRT-PCR and was five days (range one to seven days) by culture [40]. Following the resolution of fever, virus was isolated for a median of two days. n a study of 70 patients treated for pandemic H1N1 influenza A, most of whom had no comorbidities, the duration of viral shedding was reduced in patients who initiated oseltamivir therapy during the first three days of illness compared with those who began therapy on day four or later [39]. The mean duration of shedding from illness onset was five days among patients who began oseltamivir therapy during the first three days of illness, compared with seven days among those who began therapy on day four of illness, and 8.5 days among those who began therapy on day five of illness or later.",2.0

843,1429893735,"I feel like we need to address this issue if we're ever going to move the conversation forward. There is a lot of concern when it comes to whether or not vaccines are safe, whether the current schedule is safe, and whether or not vaccines cause x, y, or z. To preface this post, I think it's perfectly valid that people would want to know about safety. When your children are involved, you want what's best for them, and you don't want to cause them harm. I get it. I totally empathize. However, I feel that in general discourse, there are unrealistic expectations about safety, particularly in regard to medicine. I would like to use this thread to explore that issue. Risk is everywhere. We cannot control what happens in the universe. We can try to mitigate risk in various ways, and to some extent safety can always be improved and risk could always be shrunk. However, you're never going to completely eliminate risk or guarantee 100% safety. From a systems point of view, it's just never going to happen. So how does this relate to medicine? Every system in the body is related. If you do something to one system, it's inevitably going to affect another. That's unavoidable. So then you have to talk about risk vs. benefit. And that's really where I don't follow that logic of people who don't want to vaccinate, want alternative schedules, want to under-vaccinate, want to hold off until vaccines are safer, etc. Let's try a thought experiment. If your child needed an organ transplant, would you do it? Most parents, even those who are against or wary of vaccines, probably would to save their child's life. Even though such a procedure carries tremendous risks: risk of complications in surgery (infection, blood clots, blood loss) and risk of organ rejection. Yet most parents would take the risk because it's outweighed by the benefits. Now let's try another thought experiment. Let's say your child develops cancer. Would you try radiation and chemotherapy? Most people again probably would, even though we know that radiation and chemo drugs are toxic to healthy cells in the body. Because again, the risk is outweighed by the benefit. Now, does this mean that we shouldn't try to find safer cancer treatments? Or that we shouldn't strive to make surgery safer? No, obviously it does not. But that's not a reason to forgo these treatments in the present, because the scales are still tipped in the favor of benefit. The same logic can be applied to vaccines. Are their risks? Yes. Are those risks worse than contracting a deadly disease? No, they aren't. Just look at the numbers. The chances of experiencing an adverse reaction from a vaccine are smaller than the chances of getting the disease, especially if vaccination really starts to dip. A lot of people talk about ""natural immunity"" and how it's better than vaccination. They think that things like measles aren't really a big deal. ""My child is healthy, therefore measles won't kill him or her."" But how do you know that? Can you peer inside your child on the molecular level and evaluate their immune system? Their DNA? No, you can't. You can't predict how your child will react to a novel disease based on the fact that they don't seem to get colds often, or whatever qualitative measure people are using to announce the invulnerability of their child.So why take the risk? Let's grant just for one moment that all of the anti-vaxx assertions are true. Is it worse that your child develop allergies, or that they become sterile from mumps or blind/deaf from measles? Is it worse that your child develop a form of autism, or is it worse that they become paralyzed from polio? Is a seizure worse than the lockjaw induced by tetanus?I don't think that people really give this cost/benefit analysis much thought. They simply demand 100% safety, and that's never going to happen. They then use that to justify forgoing something that still provides more benefits than risks, simply for the fact that one day it could be done better. It doesn't make much logical sense, especially in light of how much data we have on vaccines at this point. We know vaccines prevent disease, and we know that by preventing disease we're preventing death. Logically, it's no different than performing that operation or undergoing those cancer treatments.
