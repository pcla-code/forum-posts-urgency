There is also a third distribution approach could be used. This could be C(4 choose 2) which could be implemented by say putting 2 white marbles (for Jane) and two black marbles (for John) in a blind bag. Jane draws one and then John draws another without replacement. No matter who drew what, the colors of the drawn marbles determine who gets what.

422,1426282612,"Belief in the ""hot hand"" should itself have causal effects, which we'd expect to favor the player who has the ""hot hand""; it's really surprising that the net effect, at least to the degree of accuracy measured, was statistically insignificant. Does confidence actually improve a player's performance? Or is any increase in confidence during the ""hot hand"" balanced out by decrease in confidence while not having the ""hot hand""? Do the other players or coaches believe they notice the ""hot hand"" during the game and change their behavior---passing to the player more frequently, or defending against him more aggressively?Glancing over the article linked to by [REDACTED], several studies seem to indicate that increased confidence from making previous shots does affect performance... negatively. It's overconfidence, and so players try to make harder shots, which they naturally make less frequently: ""A 2009 study by John Huizinga and Sandy Weil suggests that it might be a good idea for players to disbelieve in the hot hand, even if it really exists! In a much larger data set than GVT's, they found a similar effect; after making a basket, players were less likely to succeed on their next shot. But Huizinga and Weil had records not only of shot success, but shot location. AndÂ thatÂ data showed a striking potential explanation; players who had just made a shot were more likely to take a more difficult shot on their next attempt. Yigal Attali, in 2013, foundÂ even more intriguing resultsÂ along these lines. A player who made a layup was no more likely to shoot from distance than a player who just missed a layup. Layups are easy and shouldn't give the player a strong sense of being hot. But a player is much more likely to try a long shot after a three-point basket than after a three-point miss. In other words, the hot hand might ""cancel itself out""â€”players, believing themselves to be hot, get overconfident and take shots they shouldn't.""If people were more rational, we could randomly select teams to either believe or not believe in the ""hot hand"" and see how performance changes; unfortunately most players' beliefs about such things are not so easily changed.",2

741,1427339219,"The 5 coins are: (HH), (HH), (TT), (HT), (HT)In Q.5, we are told that a head shows up at the upper face, thus excluding (TT).The coin drawn must be one of 4 remaining coins: (HH), (HH), (HT), (HT) with equal probability.

1043,1428720670,"Instead of using binomial method, if one uses classical method, the result is different. In this case, the difference is not small.Â To explain the difference, let's use a simple example, 4Â word misprints randomly distributed into a book of 2 pages, what is the probability that first page gets 2 misprints? Â This isÂ slightly different from the original question for the sake of explanation, one should easily extend this to the actual problem.Here is the solution using what I called classical method: Let's use 0 for misprint, and 1 for division of the pages, 01000 means the first page gets 1 misprint and 2nd page gets 3. The sample space becomes: {00001, 00010, 00100, 01000, 10000}, the event where first page gets 2 misprint is 00100. So the probability is 1/5 = 0.2.Â However, if one uses binomial method, one would get $$\textstyle {n \choose k}\, p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$ with p = 1/2, k=2 and n=4. The result is 6/16 = 0.375. As you can see, there is a huge difference.Can Professor [REDACTED]or any of the TAs or any classmates please resolve the apparent puzzle for me?Â I think classical result is exact while binomial is an approximation or even flawed. I believe the binomial method is not applicable to this type of problem.

1436,1430455063,"I was waiting to see if anyone else wanted to chime in, [REDACTED], but with the course having ended this might be asking for too much dedication. Â The analysis I am going to outline will require a little patience but each step is elementary.To begin we should realise that [REDACTED]'s analysis is based on expected values and subtleties can be lost in broad brush approximations. Â So now we should formulate the question a little more precisely.To begin consider a single family. Â Let $$X$$ denote the number of girls and $$w(n):=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X= n\} = 2^{-n-1}$$ for $$n\geq0$$ the associated mass function.Â  (This is the geometric distribution seen briefly in Lecture 6.1: d.) Â Under the conditions of the problem, the family has exactly one boy and so the probability that there is one boy and no girls (in other words, boys exceed girls) is given by Â \( \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{ X = 0 \} =Â w(0) = \frac12 \). Â The probability that there is precisely one boy and one girl (in other words, the genders are in balance) is given byÂ \(Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{ X = 1 \} =Â w(1) = \frac14 \).Â And the probability that there is more than one girl (girls exceed boys) is given byÂ \(Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{ X \geq 2 \} =Â \sum_{n=2}^\infty w(n) = 1 - w(0) - w(1) = 1 - \frac12 - \frac14 = \frac14 \). Â Thus, the probability that boys exceed girls is twice as large as the probability that girls exceed boys and the intuition based on expected values only seems to break down.What if we have many families, say $$n$$? Â Suppose that the number of girls in each of these families is represented by \( X_1 \), \( X_2 \), \( \dots \), \( X_n \). Â Then the total number of boys in the population is $$n$$ while the number of girls is chance-driven and given by \( S_n = X_1 + \dots + X_n \). Â The mass function of $$S_n$$ is given by the negative binomial distributionÂ \begin{equation*}Â  (\star) \qquad w_n(k) :=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = k\} = \binom{n+k-1}{n-1} 2^{-k-n} \qquad (k\geq0).\end{equation*}How do we prove this? Â The convolutional mechanism that we had used to derive the stability of the Poisson distribution in the Dangerous Bend Lecture 10.2: p is one way to show this but a direct combinatorial argument is available. Imagine that we arrange the children from the first family from left to right first in order of age with \( X_1 \) girls followed by the sole boy; then the children of the second family with \( X_2 \) girls followed by their boy; and so on. Â Viewed from left to right in our probability model, we have a string of Bernoulli trials where we have successive ""failures"" (girls) punctuated by ""successes"" (boys). Â (It is a sad commentary that our metaphorical language of Bernoulli successes and failures may actually be a fact of life in some parts of the world.) Â The sequence terminates with the \( n \)th ""success"" and so we can think of the number of girls in total in this metaphorical sense as the waiting time (or the number of failures) till the \( n \)th success. Â If you've had a chance to listen to Dangerous Bend Lecture 10.2: t you may be struck with a feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu. Â It is not an accident: the exponential density is the continuous counterpart of the geometric mass function. Â With this understanding in mind, we realise that the final trial must be a success (the \( n \)th boy). Â If the waiting time till the \( n \)th success (that is to say, the total number of girls) is \( k \) then there must be a total of \( k + n \) trials of which the last is a success. Â But then there must be exactly \( k \) failures distributed arbitrarily in the first \( k + n - 1 \) trials. Â As we are dealing with a fair coin, the probability of this is given by the binomial probability \( \binom{k + n - 1}k 2^{-(k + n - 1)} = \binom{k + n - 1}{n-1} 2^{-(k + n - 1)} \) [in view of the binomial coefficient identity seen in Lecture 2.2: b]. Â We multiply this by \( 2^{-1} \) to account for the fact that the final trial [the \( (k + n) \)th trial] is independent of the first \( k + n - 1 \) trials and must be a success and so we recover the mass function given in \( (\star) \) for the waiting time till the \( n \)th success (or, in our context, the total number of girls).With \( (\star) \) in hand, what is the probability that the number of girls is fewer than the number of boys? Â As there are exactly $$n$$ boys, leveraging additivity, this is given byÂ \begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} w_n(k) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}Â \binom{n+k-1}{n-1} 2^{-k-n}.\end{equation*}This looks formidable but if you attempt a numerical calculation, say, for $$1\leq n\leq 100$$, you will discover that the right-hand side always seems to be equal to $$\frac12$$. Â You will surely feel that this cannot be an accident (or, at least, that this merits further investigation) and so accordingly you may be led to conjecture that\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} = \frac12 \quad\text{or, equivalently,}\quadÂ Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} = \frac12\end{equation*}for all $$n\geq1$$. Â There are several ways we can go about proving this but having guessed the answer the simplest approach is by mathematical induction. Â The base case has already been established for the case of a single family, $$n=1$$, as $$S_1 = X_1$$ and we have seen thatÂ \begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_1\geq 1\} = Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_1\geq 1\}Â = 1 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_1 = 0\}Â  Â  = 1 - \frac12 = \frac12.\end{equation*}As induction hypothesis, suppose now that $$ \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1}\geq n-1\} = \frac12$$. Â Now, the inequality $$S_n\geq n$$ is satisfied when precisely one of the following two conditions holds: either $$S_{n-1}\geq n$$ or, for some $$0\leq k\leq n-1$$, Â $$S_{n-1} = k$$ and $$X_n\geq n-k$$. Â It follows that\begin{align*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} Â  Â  &amp;\overset{\text{(a)}}=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1}\geq n\} + Â \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k, X_n\geq n-k\}\\Â  Â  &amp;\overset{\text{(b)}}=Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1}\geq n-1\} -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}Â  Â  Â  + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k\}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n-k\} \\Â  Â  &amp;\overset{\text{(c)}}= \frac12 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}Â \cdot \bigl(1 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n- (n-1)\}\bigr)Â  Â  Â Â + \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k\}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n-k\}.\end{align*}In this sequence, (a) follows by additivity; (b) by additivity to rewrite the first term on the right and by independence (as $$S_{n-1}$$ is independent of $$X_n$$) to factor the summands; and (c) by induction hypothesis and a little rearrangement of the terms of the sum to group the terms involving $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}$$. To show that $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} Â = \frac12$$ and so complete the induction it will hence suffice to show that\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = n-1\}Â \cdot \bigl(1 -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n- (n-1)\}\bigr)Â  Â  =Â Â \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_{n-1} = k\}Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq n-k\}.\end{equation*}As $$X_n$$ is governed by the geometric distribution with mass function $$w(j) = 2^{-j-1}$$ for $$j\geq0$$, we see that, for any integer $$m\geq0$$, we have\begin{equation*}Â  \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{X_n\geq m\} = 2^{-m-1} + 2^{-m-2} + 2^{-m-3} + \dotsbÂ  Â  = 2^{-m-1}\bigl( 1 + 2^{-1} + 2^{-2} + \dotsb \bigr)Â  Â  = \frac{2^{-m-1}}{1 - 2^{-1}} = 2^{-m}.\end{equation*}And, as $$S_{n-1}$$ is governed by the negative binomial mass function \( w_{n-1}(k) = \binom{(n-1) + k -1}{(n-1) -1} 2^{-(n-1)-k} \) for $$k\geq0$$, the identity we are seeking to verify isÂ \begin{equation*}Â  \binom{(n-1) + (n-1) - 1}{(n-1) - 1} 2^{-(n - 1) - (n - 1)} \cdot \bigl(1 - 2^{-1}\bigr) Â  Â  = \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{(n-1) + k - 1}{(n - 1) - 1}Â 2^{-(n - 1) - k}\cdot 2^{-(n - k)},\end{equation*}or, what is the same thing,\begin{equation*}Â  \binom{2(n-2) + 1}{n-2} 2^{-2n + 2}\cdot 2^{-1}Â  Â  = 2^{-2n + 1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{(n - 2) + k}{n - 2}.\end{equation*}Simplifying both sides by cancellation of the common power of $$2$$, we hence wish to verify the identity\begin{multline*}Â  (\ast) \qquad \binom{2(n-2) + 1}{n-2} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{(n - 2) + k}{n - 2}Â  Â  Â  \overset{\text{(d)}}= \sum_{k=0}^{n-2}\binom{n-2+k}k\\Â  Â  Â  = \binom{2(n-2)}{n-2} + \binom{2(n-2)-1}{n-2-1} + \binom{2(n-2)-2}{n-2-2} + \dots + \binom{2(n-2) - (n-2)}{(n-2) - (n-2)},\end{multline*}where the step marked (d) follows by Lecture 2.2: b as $$\binom{n-2+k}{n-2} = \binom{n-2+k}k$$. Â Simplify the algebra by writing $$m = n - 2$$. Â By repeated applications of Pascal's triangle [Lecture 2.2: c] we see that\begin{align*}Â  \binom{2m + 1}m Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m}{m-1} \\Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m-1}{m-1} + \binom{2m-1}{m-2}\\Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m-1}{m-1} + \binom{2m-2}{m-2} + \binom{2m-2}{m-3}\\[4pt]Â  Â  &amp;= \dotsb \\[4pt]Â  Â  &amp;= \binom{2m}m + \binom{2m-1}{m-1} + \binom{2m-2}{m-2} + \dots + \binom{2m-m}{m-m}.\end{align*}Identifying $$m = n-2$$ in $$(\ast)$$, we verify the given identity and hence, tracing our path backwards, that $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n\} = \frac12$$, thus completing the induction.We conclude that $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} = \frac12$$ for all $$n$$ and hence that the probability that boys exceed girls in the population is one-half.What can be said about the probability that there are exactly as many girls and boys? The probability that girls and boys are balanced is given by\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\} = w_n(n) = \binom{2n-1}n 2^{-2n}.\end{equation*}We may get a feeling about how the right-hand side behaves for large $$n$$ via Stirling's formula [which asserts that $$N!\thicksim \sqrt{2\pi N}\, \bigl(\frac{N}e\bigr)^N$$ as $$N\to\infty$$]. A little elbow grease is all that is requisite to simplify the expression on the right and we obtain\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\} \thicksim \frac1{2\sqrt{\pi n}} \qquad (n\to\infty).\end{equation*}The probability of balanced genders decreases slowly with $$n$$.We may now draw the following conclusions from the analysis. Â As $$\operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\}$$ is strictly positive for all $$n$$, we conclude that\begin{equation*}Â  \frac12 =Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n \leq n-1\} &gt;Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n+1\}\end{equation*}and so the chances that boys outnumber girls are strictly better than the chances that girls outnumber boys. Â On the other hand,\begin{equation*}Â Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\leq n-1\} -Â \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n\geq n+1\}Â  Â  = \operatorname{\mathbf{P}}\{S_n = n\} \to 0 \qquad (n\to\infty)\end{equation*}(though the rate of decay on the right is slow â€” it only decays at the rate $$n^{-1/2}$$). Â This says that for large populations boys have a tiny edge over girls but the edge is very small.We can now ask other questions such as, for a given population size, is a discrepancy seen adequately explained by this sanitised and simple model? Â We have the tools now to begin exploring such questions.",2

1037,1428688550,"Yes! Your insertion ""of"" is really great. Now if you allow me to bury our horse, I think I have a way to get the flowers to bloom on his grave.I think the mental problem of our situation occurs because we lose sight of what A and B are because the set of Aâˆ©Ac and Bâˆ©Bc do not have explicit names we can use to fully describe the parts of the implied sample space as a whole. So to describe in words our full situation let us generically define sample space Toss1 as bold A = A + Ac because Aâˆ©Ac = 0 subset A along with subset Ac are partitioned by rows (diagram Toss1 above). Similarly, B = B + Bc except that the subsets of B are partitioned by columns. (diagram Toss2 above). So when we say to Aâˆ©B we are referring to it as a subset of Aâˆ©B and as long as neither A or B are empty, then Aâˆ©B &gt; 0. In matrix algebra terms we say that A and B form orthogonal (rows and column partition lines are 90 degrees to each other) relationships whose values are determined by multiplication. The aforementioned will be strictly true as long as Aâˆ©B/B = A which is just a tautology at this point until we bring in the concept of conditional proportions. But for our coin tossing experiments we know this to be true. So OK so far.Now let's really cement in our insights by the following ""gedanken"" experiment: Place two heads, our expected number of heads in four tosses, in a row. Now place the expected two tails in a row just below the heads. Put a piece of plexiglass (designating the ending of toss 1) over the coins and scribe a horizontal line in the plastic to separate the two rows. Now put two heads in a left column in such a way as to still see the coins from toss 1 below. Similarly, place the two tails expected from our toss 2 experiment in a right hand column. Place another piece of plexiglass over these coins and scribe a vertical line in the plastic. Now note what we have here, a physical representation of our two toss sample space. Now notice that as you look down through the top plastic plate you will ""see"" Aâˆ©B as a combination of A with B by crossing the pane of plastic separating A with B. You can still ""see""Â  A across the top row and B along the left column. Their intersecting conjunction across the planes is 90 degrees to the row and column lines. We can say that our total sample space consists of orthogonal subsetsÂ of A with B.Â  The Omega of A is 4, the Omega of B isÂ  4, but the Omega of Aâˆ©B is also 4 even though it takes 8 coins to create this sample space. Now toÂ ""see""Â  our new set Aâˆ©B in a single plane, take a photo looking down through the plexiglass ""flattening"" our layers together. This would now be akin to the subsets created when tossing both coins together. These subsets could be relabeled, say AiBj. They are disjoint and strictly additive in the new sample space AxB. We no longer have to keep them in row by column arrangement to correctly calculate their combined proportions. This is akin to enumerating all the possible AxB subsets in a one planar sample space.The purpose of the rules for set algebra is to allow us to make correct inference and calculations in terms of the implied orthogonality ofÂ  subsetsÂ  A and B. E.g. AâˆªB = A + B - Aâˆ©B = Acâˆ©B + Aâˆ©B + Aâˆ©Bc = 1 - Acâˆ©Bc Next up: what the heck does conditionality really mean? Are you still interested in the conversation?",2

400,1426180209,"This is a nice little technical catch! Â I had finessed it so as not to get embroiled in measure-theoretic detail but now that you have brought it up it deserves a fuller answer. Â The student who is willing to accept the fact that the continuum arises naturally from limiting sequences of discrete experiments can ignore this â€” the main point of the exercise was to make a case for the consideration of continuum experiments. Â For the others who would like a little more technical background, read on.You are quite right: there are numbers for which there are two dyadic representations. Â Generically, any number which can be expressed as a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator can be represented in two ways: a terminating expansion (with an infinite sequence of trailing 0s) and a nonterminating expansion (with an infinite sequence of trailing 1s). Â Here's another example:$$\frac38 = .011\dot{0} = .010\dot{1}.$$But this observation is not problematic because: Â the set of real numbers with two different dyadic expansions has length zero. Â Â What you've just done is identify your first non-trivial set of probability zero! Â We may hence pick by convention either of the representations in the cases where there are two, for example, we may by convention always agree to pick the non-terminating expansion, and none of the calculations are affected as the sets are equivalent up to a set of zero length. Â Formally, with this convention under our belt, every real number $$0 &lt; x \leq 1$$ in the unit interval will have a unique non-terminating expansion which corresponds to a unique sequence of coin toss outcomes. Â This leaves out certain sequences of coin tosses from the specification (those with an infinite sequence of trailing tails). Â This entire set of sequences may be put in one-to-one correspondence with the equivalent sequences corresponding to the non-terminating expansions. Â And the latter set may be identified with a countably infinite collection of real numbers. Â Now any countable set has length (formally, Lebesgue measure) zero. Â (This has to be shown. Â But this takes us into a detour into Lebesgue's theory of measure and I will not do that here.) Â This means that the set of coin toss sequences that we have ignored collectively has zero probability. Â Adding sets of zero probability to events does not change the probability and so none of the calculations is affected.The bottom line is this: the coin tossing experiment is equivalent to the unit interval up to a set of sample points whose probability is zero.I would cheerfully have avoided this technical digression (as I did in the lecture!) but once you picked up on the technical nuance you've forced my hand!",2
527,1426574658,"Re: Homework 1 Problem 2:
I am not following why â€œThe coin lands on tails and die B shows up whiteâ€ and â€œDie B shows up redâ€ are not both valid complete characterizations of Â sample points for the described chance experiment.
For this experiment, our sample space $$\Omega$$ consists of four sample points:
1.Â  Die A shows up red, 	(with probability 3/16)
	2.Â  Die A shows up white, 	(with probability 5/16)
	3.Â  Die B shows up red, 	(with probability 5/16)
	4.Â  Die B shows up white, 	(with probability 3/16)
Whether the coin showed a head or a tail is implicit in the outcome:Â  if die A shows up, it was a head, if die B, a tail. Â The result of the coin toss seems to be merely a detail accounting for why the outcome is biased. Â We couldÂ  call outcome 4 â€œThe coin lands on tails, and die B shows up whiteâ€, but this describes the same outcome.Â  Â  As Professor [Redacted] notes in lecture 6.1b â€œIt makes little matter what we call an outcome,â€¦ a rose by any other name would smell as sweet â€¦â€

Â Nonetheless not all models are equal. Â In many cases there is a ""natural"" model for the problem. Â Usually, though not always, it is the simplest model that fits the circumstances. Â The philosophical principle called Ockham's razor dictates, abeyant any further information which leads us to reconsider, that we select the natural model and discard the others. Â Let me illustrate with a couple of examples.You are given data in the form of the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... and asked to infer a model. Â If you respondÂ $$2^n$$ then you've selected the natural model and, abeyant any further information, the exponential solution will be viewed as the ""correct"" model. Â But there are an infinity of models that can fit the given data: for example, the cubic polynomialÂ $$p(n) =1+\frac{5n}6+\frac{n^3}6$$ also fits the given data. But there are few circumstances in which the latter ""solution"" would be considered the right one. Tradition conditioned by experience leads us to the ""right"" model.Likewise, in chance, if we are given a problem involving the throw of a die, absent any further information we make the natural assumption that the die is fair (and, further, that it has six sides though we may relax this assumption if the context suggests a generalisation may be profitable). Â We can certainly posit zero probability events and they are important in the context of continuous experiments. Â (In the theory of measure this leads to a consideration of sets of measure zero and properties valid ""almost everywhere"".) Â But it is rare that zero probability events play a role in discrete settings. Â In such cases the natural models almost never involve sets of zero probability. Â The rare exceptions to this general rule almost always devolve around the desire for notational elegance and compactness: see, for instance, our notational conventions for mass functions on the integers. Â But, even in these cases, the expressions quickly devolve into a consideration of non-zero probabilities.It is in this sense that there is a ""natural"" chance model for this question. Â (The range of potential solutions given provide additional ammunition to direct one's thoughts towards the natural model.) Â The mathematician T. W. KÃ¶rner has written that ""battalions of facts, like battalions of men, are not always as strong as supposed"". Â And as in life, there are good choices and bad choices in mathematics: good choices elucidate and clarify; bad choices obfuscate and muddy the waters.It may seem that there is room for this kind of philosophical orientation and choice mainly in the applied sciences and mathematics but these considerations can also come to bear in choices and directions in pure mathematics. Â The mathematician George PÃ³lya whose aphorisms I have quoted in these lectures has written beautifully on the subject. Â If you are curious, pick up his volumes on Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning.",2

However, it leads to a result with the expected value slightly less than the smallest of the available options.

1318,1429871996,"Sorry, any one can help me understand the problem first!?What does 'pairs' here?

Indeed we are comparing an arrangement of 6 cups which is 6-tuples with an arrangement of 6 saucers ( which is another 6-tuples).If this is the case, then this problem is even harder than problem of putting 6 letters into 6 envelopes at random.( because of the repetition of colors)The Homework suggests that this is a combinatorial problem (Week 1) and not an advanced problem covered in week 8.Thank you",5
