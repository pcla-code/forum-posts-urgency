526,1382723758,"[REDACTED], I think you're conflating design and marketing. I understand your objections against creating unnecessary objects and reinventing the wheel but these IMO are complete opposites of good design.&nbsp;""It would appear that a main premise for this course is that ""gaps"" -- shortfalls between what we want and what we have -- can be addressed only by designing something new.""This is not true, nor was it stated anywhere in the requirements. Design is as much about small refinement of existing processes / objects as it is about innovation. Every problem is to an extent a UI problem, and your goal is to come up with a solution that you can explore, iterate on, verbalize and present to a larger audience.&nbsp;The purpose of this class, as far as I understand it, is to teach you how to think like a designer. This means engaging and developing your observation skills and critical thinking, and looking at everyday processes as something that can be optimized. An artifact which would result from such optimization is not necessarily a physical object - it may be a program, an improved process, even a better layout for the post-it notes stuck to ones fridge. I think you'll find it easier to identify gaps if you focus on finding problems first before limiting yourself to a particular solution (like the hypothetical gizmos you mentioned). That's why we've been asked to brainstorm and find ten gaps instead of one.",2

I've added my blog post for this week (half of it).If anyone has any time to give me some extra feedback about which prototype to select I'd be very grateful. Thank you. Here's my post:&nbsp;See the original prototypes here.Testing Prototypes for visual communication education resourceTesting was not easy this week. But the feedback that I did get made me realise I have two audiences, not one: people (students) still learning&nbsp;design and those who have gone into the industry but need a reminder or refresher.I'm creating resources to help people (mostly graphic designers) understand visual communication theory and to be able to relate that to their own design practice in order to design more effectively. The people I was testing with this week are all people that I have either taught in the past or&nbsp;lecturing colleagues&nbsp;and so they are all familiar with visual communication but would like a resource that refreshed their memories as and when needed.This audience was divided between the app and the book. Some said that the app would be best for those who have iPads and were app savvy, whereas the book would be the next best thing. Others felt that the book would be best. All liked the idea of ""dipping in"" as and when needed.But I had set out to create resources for learning and teaching that w0uld take learners through, step by step, so that they learnt visual communication and were then able to use it for themselves. Though I tested user needs with this section I was not able to test this week with any of them. For these learners&nbsp;I still feel sure that the interactive PDF would be best as it would meet the user need of not just being text as it would have links to videos, podcasts and other sites. It would be like a very small MOOC in a way. There'd be several different ones for different theories.What to decide? I'm tempted to continue with both the PDF and the app. I'm excited by the app as it is out of my comfort zone.",3

2351,1384403328,"For what it is worth, here is my take on applying design to processes.
 A user can only experience a process or service by interacting with the collection of artifacts that exist to enable the process. So if you are working on a process the techniques are the same but it&#39;s hard because you are probably actually designing many artifacts. This weeks lectures might help as [REDACTED] talks about focused versus comprehensive prototypes. If your gap involves a process maybe you could focus on one particular part of the process and prototype the artifact that enables it. 
Storyboards are a good technique for sketching process concepts and modelling and simulations are a good techniques for testing prototype processes to ensure that all of the individual artifacts interact in an integrated way to deliver good experiences.

515,1382718019,"[REDACTED], you may be being a bit unfair. The title of this course does include the words ""creation of artifacts"" and so it should hardly have come as a surprise that it includes making things. The lecturer does make a point of saying that the current exercise isn't to do with making your fortune or having the world beat a path to your door. The title of the course also includes the words ""in society"" and so there is some emphasis on doing things in a socially responsible way. The best way of learning things is often through doing something yourself. Most people doing the course probably don't have the skills or materials to make a prototype that's anything other than Heath Robinson-ish - I certainly don't. I get the impression that the definition of ""gap"" is wide enough to include one that can be solved by behavioural changes, e.g. a lunch club.",3

Rating by concept can develop a &quot;halo effect&quot; where your original preference is confirmed as you go along. I actually changed my fav as I saw the result of the matrix.[REDACTED].

1447,1383245106,"""Are there examples, where users have created or contributed to create a design artifact? ( It could be service, not just a product)""Coursera website. I took a class where students reported gaps in the organization of course materials. The reports weren't&nbsp;necessarily formal bug reports - they were just questions in the forums indicating a difficulty with some feature, for example ""Help, I don't know how to get to my next peer review."" This is an example where users sense a gap but don't necessarily have the technical language to define the problem (the buttons controlling navigation between peer reviews are not clear enough to the users). Nonetheless, they can contribute to the design by documenting the gap.The staff collected student feedback and suggestions on how to clarify the navigation, how to make course materials easier to find, and how to prevent common mistakes that would result in assignments not being submitted and students losing credit. When the course was offered next time, the layout and navigation were changed to incorporate the feedback - the result was a much improved learning experience.""Also, what makes design for a group of users harder than for yourself?""A much larger list of needs that your design must satisfy. It's entirely possible that your ""I don't care"" need is someone else's ""must have"", and you have to anticipate that in your design. This is a big challenge for me because it's easy to fall into the trap of ""I'm a pretty average user, and therefore my needs are representative of most&nbsp;everyone else's."" This assumption proved inaccurate every time I made it. You may also have to reconcile conflicting feature requests from multiple user groups. This is more difficult than prioritizing your own needs because it has a direct impact on the adoption rates of the product.",2

I just used Microsoft PowerPoint for the designs I put together.  The one above required a new font called highway gothic, but that was pretty easy to find for free.  Otherwise it's just two rectangles with rounded corners and an arrow - all basic shapes in ppt.  I haven't worked much with google docs, but I'm guessing you'll find similar tools there.In ppt you can ""save as pictures"" (file menu) which will give you a jpeg for each slide, so the image above is just a ppt slide :-).

The good thing is that, by doing what you do, you are not just helping your peers, but having a better understanding of the week concepts, so I encourage you ?â‚¬?and all students reading this?â‚¬? to do the same on the following weeks.Just to clarify about having received just 2 reviews. All students have 5 evaluators. The system works using an advanced algorithm to ensure that. After each week's deadline, the system allot peers ?â‚¬?that's why students can't submit their assignments after the deadline. So, students may receive from 5 to zero comments about their work, but this doesn't means that the work hadn't been evaluated, that is, scored.The weekly score is also calculated by the median, so ""dissonant"" scores ?â‚¬?too low or too high according with the others?â‚¬? are discarded.I hope this clarify your doubts.Cheers!",1
