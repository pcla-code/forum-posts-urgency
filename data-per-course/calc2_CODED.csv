There are different sorts of singularities: curvature singularities, gravitational singularities, space-like singularities, conical ones, time-like ones; others, predicted by general relativity which are inside black holes, among others.For instance, at the beginning of the universe, the Big Bang, was a singularity. Broadly speaking, around these singularities, things are very weird, bizarre. Due to gravitation the matter is compressed to a point of infinite density and volume zero. The time it takes to the matter to get these singularities, is infinite.There's a plenty to talk about these amazing concepts.",3

2936,1393769093,"Hi [REDACTED],Apologies for the late response! Ã‚Â The statement of Problem 3 provides a differential equation,Ã‚Â $$\frac{dG}{dt} = a - bG - \frac{G}{1+G^2}$$, tells us that this equation can be used to model chemical concentrations in a cell, and asks us to analyze the number of possible equilibria. Ã‚Â The correct answer(s) are that (i) an equilibrium exists for every pair of constants $$a$$ and $$b$$, and (ii) when three equilibria exist, one is stable and two are unstable. Ã‚Â [REDACTED] pointed out that there are some values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ for which the only equilibrium value (i.e., the only constant $$c$$ such that $$G(t) = c$$ solves the differential equation) is negative. Ã‚Â But if the equilibrium value were negative the cell could never reach equilibrium, because it can't have a negative chemical concentration. Ã‚Â For such values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ there are no physical equilibria. Ã‚Â So there are only two ways that (i) and (ii) could be the correct: either the person who wrote the problem meant to write ""every pair of constants $$a$$ and $$b$$ which might appear in nature,"" or they really meant ""equilibrium of the equation"" and not ""equilibrium of the physical system."" Ã‚Â When I wrote ""consider all values of $$a$$ and $$b$$"" above, I just meant to say that the latter is true: the problem writer wanted us to analyze equilibria of the equation. Ã‚Â It turns out that when all you care about is equilibria of the equation, the same analysis applies for all values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ regardless of whether they realistically describe a cell's chemical concentrations in nature, so one can give an answer that is correct for ""all values of $$a$$ and $$b$$'.Best,[REDACTED].",2

3219,1394686960,"hi [REDACTED],This is indeed an interesting question from the physics point of view. However if you do the physics from scratch you cannot ignore the momentum of the mass that is going out of the car (the exhaust) when you are constructing the equations of motion from scratch.Below I will use subscripts ""$$ex$$"" to denote terms related to the exhault, and subscript ""$$car$$"" for those of the car. All velocities denote the X component.It is to be noted that the velocity (relative to ground) of the different part of the exhaust are different: The exhaust is released relative to the car. So when the car is moving slow, the exhaust will have a smaller velocity in +X direction relative to ground. But when the car is moving fast, the velocity of the exhaust relative to ground in +X direction will be higher.Thus, a small chunk of exhaust (say of mass $$d m_{ex}$$) that came out when the car is moving at a velocity $$v_{car}$$ will have a momentum (relative to ground) of $$d p_{ex} = (v_{car} - V_{rel}) d m_{ex}$$ (where $$V_{rel}$$ is the speed in the -X direction at which the exhaust came out relative to the car).Thus, the net momentum of the complete exhaust (all that has ever come out) = $$p_{ex} = \int (v_{car} - V_{rel}) d m_{ex} = \int_0^t (v_{car} - V_{rel}) \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt} dt $$Next, from Newton's second law, on the complete system (that is the car and the complete mass of exhaust),$$F_{fric} = \frac{d}{dt} (p_{ex} + m_{car} v_{car})$$ (where, $$F_{fric}$$
 is the total external force on the car-exhaust system, and mostly is 
comprised of the friction between the wheel and the street).Thus, using the previous integral equation for $$p_{ex}$$ we get,$$F_{fric} = (v_{car} - V_{rel}) \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt} + \frac{d}{dt} (m_{car} v_{car})$$$$ ~~~~~ = (v_{car} - V_{rel}) \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt} +  v_{car} \frac{d m_{car}}{dt} + m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt}$$$$ ~~~~~ = v_{car} \frac{d (m_{ex} + m_{car})}{dt} + m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt} - V_{rel} \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt}$$Now, $$m_{ex} + m_{car}$$ is the total mass of the exhaust-car system, and thus due to conservation of mass, is independent of time: $$\frac{d (m_{ex} + m_{car})}{dt} = 0$$.Thus, $$F_{fric} = m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt} - V_{rel} \frac{d m_{ex}}{dt}$$Finally, we are not given the value of $$V_{rel}$$. But it will be a moderate assumption in case of a car to set $$V_{rel} = 0$$ by assuming that the speed at which the exhaust comes out relative to the car is small (this will be true, for example, if the exhaust is vented out of a vertical chimney as in trucks, thus giving it a zero X-component velocity). [Note however that in vehicles like a jet aeroplane or a rocket this is not true, and in those cases the bulk of the acceleration of the vehicle comes due to the contribution of $$V_{rel}$$].Thus, with that assumption we end up with $$F_{fric} = m_{car} \frac{d  v_{car}}{dt}$$.And the problem essentially talks about the work done by the external force, $$F_{fric}$$. So $$F = m a$$ works out nicely.This should also explain why, if the car is moving at a constant velocity of $$v_{car} = c$$ on a friction-less road, and is losing mass due to the exhaust, and the $$V_{rel}$$ is small in the X direction, why the car is not expected to accelerate in the X direction all by itself (which is intuitive, but now we have a mathematical argument).Hope this helps.S.",2

1071,1390050190,"Hi [REDACTED],Not to worry, there's an important detail hiding here: $$1/x^2$$ is not differentiable at zero (in fact it's not even defined! &nbsp;that's why i had to separately specify the value $$f$$ takes at $$0$$ above), so the usual trick of writing $$(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$$ won't work for $$f(x) = e^x$$ and $$g(x) = 1/x^2$$ at $$x=0$$. &nbsp;To do the calculation you have to go all the way back to the definition and show&nbsp;\[ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{-1/x^2}-0}{x-0} = 0\]To do this,&nbsp;notice\[xe^{1/x^2} = x \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left ( \frac1{x^2} \right)^k \left( \frac 1{k!} \right )= x + \frac 1x + \frac 1{2! x^3} + \frac 1{3!x^5} + \frac 1{4!x^7}+ \cdots \]The first term on the right tends to 0 as $$x \to 0$$ and every other term tends to $$\infty$$ as $$t\to0$$, so $$xe^{-1/x^2} \to \infty$$ as $$t \to 0$$ hence\[\frac{e^{-1/x^2}-0}{x-0} = \frac1{xe^{1/x^2}} \]tends to 0 as $$x \to 0$$, which is what we wanted to show.The function $$f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$$ is famous for its useful properties in calculus and geometry. &nbsp;You can read more about it (and other functions with interesting&nbsp;Taylor series) in the&nbsp;Approximation and Convergence section of this article:&nbsp;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series. &nbsp;Enjoy![REDACTED].",2
