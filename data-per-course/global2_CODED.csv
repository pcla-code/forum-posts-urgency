The FDA and other federal food research/inspection organizations have to ensure ingredients are safe to consume i.e BHTs in cereals, etc. I think they should also let us know if these ingredients have addictive qualities. We need to manage our diet to prevent further harm. It may require accommodating it to some extent in the beginning in order to manage it. The goal should be health eating, healthy calorie intake, healthy life style choices. Some individuals who may appear overweight are healthy and others who are underweight are unhealthy i.e. have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc...

710,1416259896,"Dear Professor, interesting proposition. I do believe Education is the solution for the majority of the problems in developing countries; the challenge is, what kind of education is the right one for those countries, right? How many Countries these days produce the professionals they really need? Even developed countries are struggling to produce more scientists, engineers, mathematicians to keep innovating ... etc. In other words and answering your question, I believe a degree from the US could be a pathway to individual success, but it doesn't address the need of a particular Country/Economy/Society and it is not culturally compelling to many of those countries. Those countries need an education system aligned to their needs and realities to really move the needle. Exposure to western political system will certainly help, but again, those countries have their own realities and ways to do business, which not necessarily are perceived locally as negative business practices. Showing them that there is a different way of doing things is very helpful, but ultimately they will have to pick and choose what they believe are the best accepted business practices in their countries to be successful and make a positive impact in their societies.",2

Health and welfare benefit plans may be either defined-benefit or defined-contribution plans as explained in the following:Defined-benefit health and welfare plans??specify a determinable benefit, which may be in the form of reimbursement to the covered plan participant or a direct payment to providers or third party insurers for the cost of specified services. Such plans may also include benefits that are payable as a lump sum, such as death benefits. The level of benefits may be defined or limited based on factors such as age, years of service, and salary. Contributions may be determined by the plan's actuary or be based on actual claims paid, hours worked or other factors determined by the plan sponsor. Even when a plan is funded pursuant to agreements that specify a fixed rate of employer contributions (for example, a collectively bargained multiemployer plan), such a plan may nevertheless be a defined-benefit health and welfare plan if its substance is to provide a defined benefit.Defined-contribution health and welfare plans??maintain an individual account for each plan participant. Such plans have provisions that specify the means of determining the contributions to participants' accounts, rather than the amount of benefits the participants are to receive. The benefits a plan participant will receive are limited to the amount contributed to the participant's account, investment experience, expenses, and any forfeitures allocated to the participant's account. These plans also include flexible spending arrangements.As i understan ""pay as you-go"" is very similar than defined benefit. In some countries of Europe Welfare state covers defined benefit programs with taxes (normally income taxes, you must pay to the govermenet part of your salary).Them all the expenses of the system are covered by taxes as whole.

732,1416325385,"I think that college education is a bit of both -- an aspiration, since one's status is definitely marked by attending a University, and hopefully, college education will lead to increased economic power. The problem is the student debt. College tuition is extremely costly and it rises each year at least by 2%. There are a few ways around this -- for example, by attending community college and then attending a more prestigious university. However, student debt will still exist, so if a college graduate cannot afford to buy a house and remains in debt for several years, that will pose a problem regarding increased economic power. As long as jobs are available after graduating from a university, there is optimism. However, with the economy remaining flat, jobs are difficult to come by for graduates.??Regarding your other point, I definitely believe that western political culture affects the middle class in developing countries especially because of Isomorphism.??",2

At the same time, the difficulty with any model is that it is a simplification of reality. I would love to learn which other models are being used to make sense of worldwide trends. I wonder whether the seemingly comprehensive model introduced this last week, ""the four institutional gearboxes shaping global dynamics in the 21st century"" could be further improves upon, taking into account some of the latest trend(s). For instance shouldn't the exponentially increasing digitalisation of the world (think Internet of Things, Big Data, additive manufacturing) and the impact that new business models have, become a bigger part of the analysis of global trends? Just think of how entire sectors have been changed ""overnight"" such as the travel industry (e.g. Expedia, but also AirBnB), the book and printing industry (e.g. Amazon and Adobe pdf). Now, new developments are rapidly approaching of which the first signals are already there, such as industrial internet by General Electric, where through sensors and big data they get a better grip on the use by their customers and therefore build bigger barriers to entry. The financial sector that is confronted with peer-2-peer lending and crowdsourcing. The educational markets that are confronted by MOOCs and services as Khan Academy.The last years, mass production has been taking place more and more in Asia. This model was mostly based on lower labor costs. Labor costs are increasing in countries as China, while customer demands are more focussed on Just-in-Time delivery, and products need to become more customized. Lead times of months are less-and-less feasible. 3D printing/additive manufacturing will become the way to solve the issue; it will make lead times tremendously short, and may also move manufacturing to where the consumption takes place. As Marc Andreesen has said, any sector is becoming a software sector.These are just some of the trends taking place. It would be nice to see how these factors would still further change wordwide positions, maybe not tomorrow, but maybe already next week, or otherwise certainly in the near years to come.Once again, thank you Prof. [REDACTED]. You did a great job of giving some guidance of making sense of the global trends to come. Let's all contribute to further improve on the model.[REDACTED]??",2

At the beginning of class, I asked all my students why they want to learn English.?? Many of the girls and young women shared that it was their families who encouraged them to study English, that indeed they were there ""for my family.""?? I think this shows how the women especially are seen by the family as the leading option to better education, and thus better income and financial options for the overall family.?? Whereas the boys and young men seem more encouraged to go out to do more manual labor, to drive cabs and trucks, to work in agribusiness, for example....?? The girls, on the other hand, seem to have aspirations to work in law, education, health care, etc. This is NOT to suggest that boys and young men don't have higher aspirations for themselves.?? It's just interesting to see how families and family decision making play a huge role, particularly in developing countries, around who goes to school and who gets educated.There is no doubt in my mind, based on my experience in India (however limited), that this trend of emancipation of women and greater education options for women is going to have major implications on population growth, as women who gain education tend to delay bearing children, and that family size is directly impacted by the level of education of the woman -- you could say, the true head of household the world over is the woman!Further evidence can be found in places like Iran where women outnumber men on college campuses.This trend seems to be just beginning in many parts of the developing world, so we can reasonably expect that population growth and family size will continue along the ""low"" to moderately low projection, as discussed in class.-- [REDACTED]??????

842,1416693332,"Dear [REDACTED], I find the question you pose really interesting. I too am becoming increasingly frustrated with the trends in growing inequality in the US. I also am increasingly angry at the role corporate multinationals, also many of which are approaching the point of industry monopolies, and their role in generating increases in income inequality. These are my thoughts in response to your questions... (this is my general train of thought)In terms of economic growth it is viewed as the ideal because I believe what it is considered to imply is that with more money moving around the economy the quality of life for the general population is also thought to increase. I think though this often does not display the whole picture, and as a response that is why many are pushing to not view GDP as the sole indicator for the economic stability of a country. But from a corporate perspective economic growth is viewed as the most important factor. And to be honest, with the current economic model of capitalism, I am not sure if it will be possible to separate the incessant drive of economic growth from the capitalist corporate business model. I believe the goal is always to make more and more money. But we are talking about a system, overall, that has limited resources across the board, and so corners need to be cut somewhere in order to continually maximize profit, and those cuts are being proven to not be made at the executive level, at least not in the US. I have a professor that pointed out to our class that when the economy was going into a tailspin during the most recent recession, in Japan, many corporate executives cut their own pay instead of laying off tens of thousands of employees like what happened here. Which seems to mean it is more a problem in the US than with the corporate capitalist system as a whole. I have yet to understand this dynamic in its entirety, but I truly think it is related to social and cultural norms present in the US, which I think tend to be more cut-throat, individualistic, and self-serving. We tend to be less community minded. I honestly think this is the root of the problem in the US, cultural values. I mean if you think about the foundation of this country it was founded on the notion of individual freedom, innovation, and capitalism. I hope that with women joining the workforce in greater number, and with women holding higher positions we are able to rein in the corporate greed. However, if the statistics shown in this weeks lecture are correct this could very well be. If women are more civic minded, more risk averse, and tend to be more forward thinking this could very well translate to the business sector. I think though the next question is how we can get more and more women to these upper management positions given the number of barriers also mentioned in this lecture. From what I can see, it may be one of the best chances we have to alter this economic system which is proving to benefit an increasingly small few. ",2

about obesity in countries less developed or undergoing economic crises. I was
born and raised in Greece and see that my country is undergoing a
transformation (one of many at this time), which is instigated by the financial
struggle its citizens are going through. Friends, relatives and Greeks in
general, have been ?â‚¬?shaping up?â‚¬? as a reaction - I seem to believe- to the instability the country is facing. The
reasoning behind the fitness frenzy or healthy lifestyle is as simple as
""people have nothing else to do that they could afford"" or ""it
is an effective way of decompressing daily stress"". It has nothing to do
with affording to eat much as Julija mentioned about Latvia. ??Another
reason Greece seems to be in the healthy and slim frenzy is the country?â‚¬?s citizens?â‚¬?
reaction to western diets or eating trends. During the recession Greece is
abstaining to any non-Greek or non-traditional habits, which includes western
diets. People in Greece have fully adopted the healthy Mediterranean lifestyle

305,1415427830,"Great question. I like that you're not afraid to call BS on what might not make sense in the lectures.To go back to your original question, I think the three paradoxes (and thank you [REDACTED] for making it easier to understand the adoption dynamics language) are not unique to globalization if you define globalization as the aspects of the modern world which clearly and directly are linked to multiple nation-states - but I think that's part of the challenge with globalization - it's not just a question of ""Japan shipping more products to the US"" or ""people in Africa using Google,"" but there's a higher-level phenomenon that shapes what happens both in globalization and within an individual nation state over the past 20-30 years, and that's really just the fact that things are changing WAY faster than they ever have before in human history.I think that's why these three paradoxes (1 - the system is both highly predictable and highly unpredictable; 2 - everyone copies each other but everyone gets really different results using the same formulas, products, slogans, etc.; and 3 - everyone tries to do the same thing while still trying to be unique or specialize) are just as much paradoxes of the speed of change and the manner in which things are changing.Part of what's driving so much change is that firms, nation-states, consumers, etc. are trying to copy one another based on the various ""drivers"" the professor outlined, but when you import or copy something, you inherently lose part of what you're copying, especially when you're bringing it into a radically different environment - like the US vs. Kenya example above - and in that sense you're changing Kenya to make it more like the US, but you're also making it more obvious how much Kenya is different from the US by importing US institutions, products, etc.I definitely think this also holds true within nation-states - in other words, I agree, yes, these are true not just in globalization - but I don't think that makes them any less valuable for understanding globalization.I agree about the academic jargon and I too had trouble understanding some of that particular slide. ??Part of the challenge with academic jargon is you're talking about things that require very nuanced, sometimes technical thought, and everyday language isn't really designed for this type of sophistication. ??I find jargon pretty frustrating sometimes, but I do have to admit that it's a lot of times even harder describing these concepts without it...??",3

[REDACTED] that or the most part my generation does not see the current massive debt
problem as ours. While the U.S. government debt is a serious problem that can't
be ignored, speaking from experience, my generation is much more concerned with
figuring out our own personal debt before even beginning of thinking of
tackling the national debt. While our parents may have been laid off during
this economic downturn my generation was not laid off because no one would hire
us to begin with. With little (if any) experience companies did not want to
take risks on recent grads so we went back to school being told that more
education would increase our chances of getting hired (and with higher intro salaries).
So we went back to school and got our second degree and once graduation rolled
around we were not able to find jobs because now we were over-qualified. Many
are now working part-time and can barely afford daily life costs (housing,
food, transportation, education debt, insurance, etc.) and could care less
about government debt because of their own poor financial situation. Once our
personal debt is handled (i.e. a large amount of us have full-time decent
paying jobs and are not having to chose if we buy food or put gas in our cars)
I believe that we will look at the national debt as being our own.
While Millennial?â‚¬?s are going to have to address
the U.S. debt issue sooner rather than later (and I believe that the issue is important
to Millennial because they have seen first-hand what personal debt has done to

- advertising regulation like the cigarette advertising regulation that should state or picture the long-term effect of consuming the products
-  increasing taxes for such of junk foods, or subsidizing or supporting health organics foods, ??- developing better cold chain of fresh perishable goods to support health quality food materials

998,1417314573,"The two major events that seem to have rocked this quarter are 1- the 
falling oil prices and 2- Japan's recession. One would only naturally 
ask if these events are related to each other or if one is a consequence
 of the other. We shall attempt to ascertain just that by looking at 
some related aspects of these events. We shall also attempt to 
understand the potential impact of these scenarios on India and its 
economy.The
 implications for India are many and quite varied at that, but before we
 plunge into the effects on India, lets go over some of the attributes 
that have been responsible for the present state of affairs shall we? in
 particular we shall be looking at Japan's recession, the shale oil 
productions in the US and the woes of the OPEC and GCC in the face of 
diving oil prices.Recession in JapanJapan
 has been in a state of continuous low growth and deflation for quite a 
while now. In 1985 Japan along with five other governments signed the 
'plaza accord' with the US to depreciate the USD in relation with the 
Japanese Yen (JPY); this step backfired almost instantly due to Japan's 
trade restrictions specifically concerning its imports.Japan's 
internal debt rose to a staggering 2+ times that of it's GDP. In April 
2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came about with a policy to increase the 
taxes in an attempt to reduce the government Debt; this may have 
triggered the current recession that has hit Japan. There are many that 
believe this recession will be short lived and that @ 2% levels, the 
inflation will actually stimulate consumption demands.But Japan 
had some weird asset allocations in this matter; the country has 
witnessed near zero interest rate for quite some time now, and ideally, 
established wisdom would suggest that this would foster a rise in 
consumption. But Japan has an ageing workforce and quite the retiree 
population and although the stock market has seen some recovery, it 
hasn't been enough to translate into any actual wealth upshot or 
increased consumption. For over two decades this has been the plight of 
the stock markets and as a result the investor sentiments have been 
indisposed.How
 exactly does this impact India and her economy as of Q4 2014? We shall 
come to that, but before we do, let us examine another important news 
that seem to be rocking the financial world lately.Crude Oil Prices, Shale Oil and the OPECOil,
 the one thing that drives prices and investors all around the world. 
it's an international 'Financial Product' in it's crude form isn't it? 
The prices have dropped to an all time low of less than $83 per barrel ! The
 implications of this are just tremendous and they affect everyone all 
around the world. I know your heads are just spinning at all the 
possibilities that this would open up and indeed it should be. But let's
 also examine how this drop in prices came about to be yeah?It 
had its start somewhere in China's decrease in import of this 
hydrocarbon. Being one of the largest importers of crude, a significant 
drop in consumption levels by this nation could spell disaster for the 
oil revenue dependent countries. Then on top of this already growing 
turbulence, Japan slumps into a recession and the USA which has so far 
been a prominent member among the oil importing countries has shifted 
away to the indigenous shale oil production. As a result Oil prices that
 had been at $100+ a barrel suddenly fell to $80 per barrel.Under
 such circumstances there are only two things that the oil revenue 
dependent governments can possibly do that conventional wisdom would 
suggest. 1- Cut down on production. 2- Reduce the price of Crude oil. 
But as the scenario stands, the OPEC headed by Saudia have decided not 
to cut down on production and instead continue with the current output; 
while leaving the prices to the influence of the market forces of Demand
 and Supply. Now, although this will have a toll on the economy of some 
countries in the Middle East, nations like Saudia are well buffered by 
their cash reserves to survive this slump for sometime. Other countries 
who are not so well buffered have decided to take on economic 
reformation to battle the falling oil prices and reduce their dependence
 on the revenue from the Gulf Oil. (refer to the below for more 
information on the state of affairs in the Middle East)http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/25/us-kuwait-finmin-idUSKCN0IE0AH20141025http://gulfnews.com/business/economy/kuwait-s-emir-says-oil-price-fall-shows-need-to-diversify-economy-1.1405119The
 newly discovered shale oil reserves in the US and it's production 
within the US soil has led to a drop in demand for the Arabian oil. The 
US had long been one of the biggest importer of crude. This drop in 
imports combined with the impact from China and Japan have caused quite a
 bit of turbulence within the GCC and the OPEC countries. 'Brent Crude' 
fell to $80 a barrel. Current trends however indicate that the Middle 
East hopes to combat the US shale oil production with sustained low 
prices. This is a contrasting irony in itself, as the fear of one would 
stop the other from breaking boundaries. Shale oil is expensive to 
produce and the identified reserves are not large enough to justify low 
cost production. Therefore the approach of the OPEC at keeping the 
prices of Oil at $80/barrel range seems to be doing the trick for now. 
As the very idea of expanding shale oil production will keep the crude 
oil prices in check and the very idea of sustained low prices in the 
crude market is enough to put off expanding on the shale oil reserves. 
For countries like Iran and Russia, this $80 per barrel is very bad 
business indeed. They would require a sustained price of $110 per barrel
 to balance out their Balance of Payments; but this is of course good 
news for India.Impact on the Indian EconomySo
 finally we reach the cherry to the pudding, India is in a unique 
position to reap the benefits of this unprecedented economic turmoil, at
 least while it lasts. Japan's recession means a devaluation of the JPY;
 now although it means that India will be in no position to receive the 
$35Mm FDI inflow that PM Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe had agreed to, it does not 
mean that we are at the loosing end.The devalued JPY will mean 
that it is an attractive means for Investors to buy foreign assets and 
risky ones at that, in other countries. India in this regard hold the 
unique advantage in the Asian markets. With China and Japan out of the 
picture and the rest of the prospective nations weakening amid inflation
 or turmoil; making India the ideal market to invest in. The market is 
large enough to absorb the capital inflow that will come in and 
receptive of the FDI inflow as well. Although the debt market in India 
has been attractive in terms of return, it still has a long way to go 
before the average middle class can begin to invest in it. For now the 
sentiments run high on savings deposits and low risk investments 
including insurance products. This is also one of the reason why the 
economy has remained quite strong and shielded from the impact of the 
market turmoil that has gripped most of the other Asian markets.Although
 it has its own faults and demerits, from an investor standpoint, the 
inflation is comparatively low and the common household savings are 
still equity averse. But 2015 could just prove to be the best year for 
India; if you get what I mean.The trends in the Oil production 
seem to favor India as well. Low cost of crude oil means a decrease in 
the price of Petrol and Diesel. Saudia has every plan to regain the 
Asian markets by offering attractive incentives; low prices will also 
see a rise in China's import of oil that had diminished (which was the 
very reason for the start of this cycle) India being in the middle just 
has a comparative advantage without even having asked for it. This also 
seems to comply with Saudi Arabia's decision to leave the price of oil 
to the forces of demand and supply. Increase in consumption will 
eventually see a rise in the oil prices and the prices will stabilize at
 a higher margin than it is now. In the mean while India can squeeze out
 the best of this opportunity with proper planning and execution.The
 ambitions plan to propel investment to 40% of GDP just seems more 
feasible now. As far as India is concerned this seems to be a blessing 
in disguise; but of course this does not come without its own risks. The
 scenario could turn upside down any moment. Indian economists are now 
closely monitoring the scenario and contemplating all possible 
situations. But as i would like to believe, 2015 seems very bright for 
the India's economy.",2

I disagree with you when you say that Word bank serves as banker of central bank. what ever the central bank you consider (FED, European Central Bank, etc...), their roles is very different of the role of Word Bank. 
World Bank provides loans at preferential rates to member countries in difficulty. In return, it demands that policies (called ""structural adjustment policies"") are taken, for example, limit corruption, maintain a balanced budget or facilitate the emergence of a democracy. In addition to loans, it also finance (directly or indirectly) of NGO projects, and conducted extensive research related to the development of each country. This is the role that the Asian bank wants to play but may be on a regional scale.
The Central Bank is a state agency or parastatal. This organization is a public authority, or it is mandated by the state. Its mission is to manage the money monopoly of the state. it acts as lender of last resort to the second-tier banks. it does not lend to the World Bank.

Even during WW2 some American companies maintained ties with their subsidiaries in Germany. It is more evident now in Ukraine. Quite a few EU countries, specially Germany and France continue doing business with Putin and are unwilling to take any serious steps that could prevent him from backing the anti-government rebel forces in the east of Ukraine.

230,1415299831,"Great topic, [REDACTED]!?? Looking ahead, in my opinion, means looking at the past and seeing what may change in the future.It seems to me the two biggest factors influencing globalization are transportation and communications.?? In some sense, globalization has existed for 100s of years - see Marco Polo and the Silk Road, the Roman and British Empires as only a few examples.?? However, before the advent of cheap energy (coal, then oil, then natural gas) and the machines that arose from it, transportation was primitive and distances long.?? Transportation and communication from, say, India to England was measured in months, not hours and nanoseconds as they are today.?? Globalization must have been a cumbersome beast back in the day, and very expensive, so there wasn't much of it.If you accept the premise that transportation and communication are the two biggest drivers of globalization (and you're certainly free to disagree with me), then it may follow that disruption of one of those drivers would act against globalization and shift relationships to regional rather than global axis's.?? And likely as a consequence increase global tensions.So, based on those premises, one might guess that the growing cost of energy might shift trade and relationships to a regional rather than a global level.?? If it simply costs too much to move people and products from one place to another, the distances have to shorten and production becomes localized.Oil prices (Brent crude) have risen globally from $10-15/barrel in 1999 to about $80-85/barrel today and have been mostly over $100 the past few years.?? That energy cost is embedded in literally everything in our lives today, from our cars to cell phones to clothes to food (especially food!).?? And demand for energy is ever increasing.So, in my opinion, if globalization breaks down, it will happen from energy scarcity and competition.?? As two of many current sources of energy tension, see Europe versus Russia over Ukraine and China's incursions in the South China Sea.",2

640,1416095958,"Both of you make very good points. [REDACTED], I agree that the British Empire had a profound impact on the world as we currently know it. Your proposition is not at all dumb. At present it still has an enormous influence even as its political power wanes dramatically. However, I agree with Anonymous that prior empires had extraordinary impact as well, both in the world in those eras and subsequently.Each empire has forged links and left influences far beyond the source 'nation'. When each fell many institutions, artifacts and recorded bodies of knowledge were sidelined, destroyed, thrown in disarray etc but vestiges and/or documentation lay in wait for later re-examination. One example is the gathering of world knowledge in the Alexandrian library, I believe later largely destroyed by Christian 'crusaders' (not one of Christianity's better moments); however, usually some documents are smuggled to safe havens or fortuitously survive these events. The influence of Christianity spread via the Roman Empire after Constantine, all the way west to the British Isles, and in various permutations remained since. Its principles under-gird the current Westminster system (possibly one of Christianity's better moments). Also the European Renaissance drew upon classical influences of the Greek (consider Plato, Socrates, Aristotle...)??and Roman Empires, both of which also laid foundations for democracy and the architecture of state although with differences. Then there is the body of knowledge known as Mathematics which has incrementally developed over millenia, having drawn upon the brilliance of minds nurtured in the Ottoman, Greek, Roman Empires and subsequently European Renaissance thinkers and beyond.??In the mid-late 1800s, European artists and thinkers began to look to 'exotic' cultures (beyond Europe via colonies) for a fresh vision. It was still European-centric and often quite condescending. However, from the mid twentieth century there has been an increasing East-West meeting of minds philosophically and politically/economically. Some may say the West is still arrogantly imperial in significant institutional ways.??This account is all very Middle East/European centered: an indication of how deeply rooted I am in my British-European roots as an older Australian whose parents and grandparents talked of ""the mother country"" and gave me fiction books to read set in England and Europe, so that my own landscape was a foreign land to me until I finally read books set in Australian landscape.A final clue to the colonial impact of the British Empire - in partial support of Brian's assertion - is that the English language has now largely eclipsed French as the International language. Even if the West 'falls' or is superseded, it is highly likely that the language will remain ??as a global communication conduit??for a very long time as Latin did (finally removed from Catholic services mid last century, still remains in international scientific and British legal language).??Cheers,[REDACTED]",2

754,1416390937,"Immigration to the United States is such a touchy issue because the average, uninformed American doesn't want to come to terms with the fact that this is a country that has historically been a refuge for people suffering injustices or substandard quality of life in their home countries. Yet we've continually made the immigration process more and more tedious and regulated, thanks in no small part to the expansion of paternalistic welfare assistance programs politicians have put in place to secure the votes of the poor and minorities. The hypocrisy of it all is that the US government (not its people) bear a great deal of the responsibility for the terrible conditions in these immigrant's home countries, particularly those coming from Latin America and the Middle East. How often did the US send troops to places like Guatemala, Iran, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic to prop up authoritarian regimes that did nothing but stuff their pockets with their nation's wealth and leave their people to starve or worse? And now that the Cold War is over you still have the US participating actively and covertly in places like Mexico, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, creating the incentives in these countries to emigrate but shutting their own doors! A great start to solving this dilemma is ending interventionist US military policy around the world and implementing an immigration strategy like the one proposed by UChicago economist Gary Becker in which work permits and entry visas are treated as market goods. The current quota system in place grossly underrepresents the demand for entry into the Untied States and creates the incentive for people to enter illegally and thus facilitate other criminal behavior like the smuggling of contraband. An immigration solution like Becker's would reduce the number of people resorting to illegal means to enter the country and would free up US Border security to screen for criminals and other nefarious people trying to enter.",2

For me, the worst is the ""maintenance"" fees that some countries charge. So, if you work during 3 years in a country then you move to other, and you only retire in 30 years. That country will charge you a fee, because your pension account doesn't have any income, so with time this money will disappear.

Somalis are migrating to the capital Nairobi were there is already a part of the city called Eastleigh predominantly inbabited by Somali migrants or Kenyans with Somali origin.

There are increasing tenstions between Kenyans and Somalis in Nairobi. Kenyans don't like their expansion in Nairobi and also the threat of terrorist attacts by Al-Shabab (there were already many of them in Nairobi - most medialized was the Westgate shopping mall shooting).

1159,1418186787,"Would like to shift the discussion somewhat to something
that has been bothering me about global warming and its underlying cause.?? I see a lack of intellectual/academic and
even personal integrity on both side of the divide on the global warming
debate.?? The questions, also briefly discussed
by [REDACTED], is whether there is a long term global warming trend that
trumps the effect of man created emissions.??


In 1660 the Glacier Bay glacier in Alaska was in a valley substantially
back from the hedge of the sea, by 1750 the little ice age had thrust the
glacier forward?? covering the entire ??land and further jutted the glacier into the
sea, in 45 years it retreated five miles (even though world population was still
relatively small), by 1880 it retreated 40 more miles, eliminating in the
process the original valley now covered by water, and today one needs to go up
65 miles up the bay to view the tidewater glaciers. 

The question is: if there were no humans on this planet,
would global warming still happen.?? One
does not hear much about this critical questions from scientists, likely
because the answer is enmeshed in politics or political correctness and there
is money to be made by sticking to 'men is the cause'.?? (I believe many scientists must be aware of
the secular trend but are preferring to keep quiet).?? 

The response to the question is critical because
it impacts the solution that is required to address the problem.?? If?? it
is a long term trend, then let's start migrating people from low lying areas,
build seawalls around major cities near oceans- as in New Orleans, basically
have a long term plan to address the inevitable.?? If caused by man, it may be worthwhile to
remove man from the earth (just kidding).??
My belief is that we are in a long term trend, with the speed of the
warming accelerated by man-made emissions.??
Thus there would
still be a need to address the emissions into the atmosphere to at least not accelerate the trend further.?? ",2
420,1415701294,"Since much of this week's discussion centred around the issue of obesity it led me to consider the merits and pitfalls of markets, as well as governments, response to this global epidemic.??Whilst it is essential to keep ""what is"" in the forefront of our minds when it comes to addressing significant trends in economics and society, to what extent do we accept the majority of people with self-debilitating conditions and alter social, political, and economic norms accordingly as opposed to using the Nudge Theory proposed by behavioural economics to slowly change direction?Sure, there are benefits to individual companies and entrepreneurs, especially in food, clothing and medical-related industries by capitalising on the obesity epidemic and all of the ensuing health and psychological problems it presents, but is it the right thing for societies in do???Would it not be a wiser course of action to, in the short term, provide what is needed to make life a bit easier for the obese, but long-term shouldn't the focus be on engaging in business and cultural avenues encouraging those in this unfortunate state to get the education and resources needed to overcome their weight and health issues? Entrepreneurs could make just as much money providing goods and services to promote health rather than disease.I am not in favour of making an ailing population the norm. I have several members of my family and close friends who suffer terribly with issues relating to either obesity, smoking, alcohol, or drugs (legal and illegal) and unfortunately this has caused chronic illness and even death amongst some of my loved ones. A similar plight has befallen over 1 billion people worldwide and is growing. Furthermore, this is only factoring in the obese, not the overweight, which I imagine would bring the total of the world's population with an unhealthy weight to well over 50%.??Any thoughts about whether economics and politics should make use of ethics, morality, and public good in setting policy and practises? I am obviously in favour of such measures.",2
113,1415118606,"I have also commented on the paradoxes; and I share [REDACTED]'s view.?? Growing globalization does not make the world more predictable in my view.?? Perhaps instead it creates common ground for global actions, such as the coordinated efforts of the Fed, the ECB, the IMF and other central banks during the 2008 financial crisis (isomorphism of financial institutions and practices).?? The crisis was surprising (unpredictable, I guess, but in hindsight perhaps fully predictable - many smart people warned of the packaging and selling of junk loans to credulous dupes (banks) in the months and years leading up to it).?? However, the response to the crisis was predictable and had the desired calming effect, ie. crisis did not, except in isolated cases, result in a global run on the banks.Whether locally or globally we are still subject to the weaknesses of human nature and the madness of crowds.?? For example, except for the few, most of us still think the stock markets are least risky when prices are high and rising and most risky when they are low and crashing.?? Those weaknesses extend to global behaviors, I think.To me, perhaps the most powerful slide in the first week's presentations was the one showing how much the Great Recession was correlated worldwide compared to past recessions (showing that 90% of nations contracted in harmony, versus 30-40% in past recessions).?? Too bad the chart did not extend back to the Great Depression for comparison.?? It seemed clear to me from that slide that the consequences of globalization and its tight(er?) connections between nations results in a more coordinated global economy ...... during good times and bad.It also highlights the need for at least some supranational institutions and standards to mitigate the inevitable future ""once in a lifetime"" events.?? As example, I can think of the Basel accords to hold banks in all countries to minimum permanent capital ratios (to mitigate against insolvency, panic and contagion) and international accounting standards (boring, I know, but to maintain integrity of financial markets).?? As always, its a trade-off between regulation (a cost to society) and innovation (a benefit).All that said, as humans our destiny seems to be to forever repeat our past mistakes, each generation relearning the lessons of our parents.",2

883,1416836179,"Dear All,Here are my thoughts of the trade bloc policies based on my observation of EU policies.Pros: The trade within the bloc is increasing dramatically. All countries that joined EU witnessed dramatic increase in trade with countries within the bloc (more investments leading to more export as well as import) The next big thing is the structural investments encouraged by EU. The memberships fees are distributed for purposes often ''forgotten'' by the government. By the ''forgetting effect'' I mean the budget cuts that member states do often, which leads to lower investment in infrastructure projects. EU does not have such constraints as predetermined membership fees is distributed as per long-term perspective lasting 6-8 years. The next thing is free flow of labor (which leads also to negative consequences). After joining the EU, many people from Eastern Europe moved west (mainly UK/Netherlands) in search of better paid work. This lead to an increase in average pay in domestic countries (as the unemployment lowered) but also lead to negative budgetary consequences (the pension system fees decreased rapidly). In the immigration countries their economy became more competitive as the immigrants were on lowest-end of wage scale.?? However their unemployment must rose a bit (not much however considering that their citizens were not willing to work for such low salaries as immigrants do). Cons: Some pathological consequences of policies reduced. For instance, the farmers are paid not to produce certain groceriy so that not to lower its price on common market. This makes people also lazy as ''EU-money'' is given for not working! The next thing is that EU-made infrastructure investments-money is often wasted. The roads bild for EU money must meet certain strict requirements?? that are silly, like building very costly noise barriers next to the highway in the rural areas where noone lives. Cost of such barriers can increase the cost of road by more than 30%! In other projects it is often so that when it is close to the end of budgetary financial perspective and there is still plenty of money not used for certain purposes, the money is quickly spend on not-needed, unnecessary projecrts in order not to return the money back to the budget of the EU (which happens in case when resources are not fully utilized).As you can see from the examples that I have given, the mechanisms behind being a member of integrated trade bloc lead often to inefficiencies and non-rational actions that economic superorganisations should prevent rather than encourage.Maybe you can name a few other strange actions existing within trade blocks (maybe not only EU, but from other blocs as well (NAFTA maybe?)).I am looking forward your input!",2

factors that will change shortly the economical environment in the world. As
change drivers he highlights the beginning of a new paradigm of transport,
energy and communication base on the ?â‚¬?Internet of things?â‚¬?, integrating in it
the ?â‚¬?Internet of energy?â‚¬? (base in a pull of many different renewable and
no-renewable energies), the ?â‚¬?internet of logistics?â‚¬? made by intelligent system
to integrate horizontally the whole logistic process. In this process will play
a big role the 3D printing and the renewable energy and the consolidation of
collaboration economy. All those will suppose to increase tremendously the
efficiency to produce and provide products and services and this will lead an
economy with a marginal cost very close to zero.

It must have withered away as a result of conflicts between schools of thought, evolution of the concepts of groups, communities, societies, nations, religions,cultures, identity, societal and economic norms, boundaries and so on driven by a desire &amp; need to 'protect' interests of groups, communities, societies, nations et el. The second coming of globalization is like history repeating itself. This time round, it's a need to globalize driven by-saturation &amp; stagnation in developed economies, rapid development in developing and emerging economies, liberalization of state policies to promote and / or endorse partial or full free trade, development and availability of multiple channels of access, communication, transportation, logistics and exchange as is manifest in the innovations in telecommunications, travel, internet, processes and the compelling ??'Utility' of these technological innovations to promote interactions amongst cross border communities. Hence globalization is net positive for the human race. However, just as absolute power corrupts absolutely, so with globalization. The crux question is whether the powers that drive globalization and hold resources and network to do so are doing it 'responsibly'. To an extent driving participation in the globalization phenomenon and process is done responsibly, it would reap huge returns for the human race.
