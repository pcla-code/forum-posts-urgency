First of all, I have never said that you have to treat your patients or I treat my patients exclusively with homotoxicologic medicine... Why? Because I don&#39;t think like that!
Homotoxicology is a complementary therapy. I don&#39;t use it alone.
For example Traumeel, this is the medication that has deeper studies, Traumeel is an inflammation  regulatory medication, it makes the effect and NSAID, this medication is used by sport teams like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, etc.
Remember that the water we use in our clinics or the hospital is Sterile! It won&#39;t have faeces, or any other thing!? Or do you inject water from the faucet!? I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t!
I&#39;m not defending the pharmaceutical Heel, but I think like all the other pharmaceuticals, Heel also have quality controls.
Believe me, I understand your scepticism, you are not the only one with these questions.
Of all the medicine they have, maybe 5-10% is diluted above the number of Avogadro, and not all the components.
I invite you to study a little bit of this topic, and if you want try it. With yourself if you want, so you can prove that am not inventing, dreaming or lying!

equivalence is a logical fallacy where there appears to be a logical 
equivalence between two opposing arguments, but when in fact there is 
none. Journalists use a form of this logical fallacy when comparing two 
sides of a scientific debate in an attempt to provide a balance between a
 scientific and denialist point of view. However, there is no 
equivalence between the two sides, when one is supported by evidence, 
and the other side with little or no evidence, of which most is of low 
quality. In other words, in false equivalence, someone will state that 
the opposing arguments have a passing similarity in support, when, on 
close examination, there is large difference between the quality of 
evidenceThere are often two sides, but oftentimes, the evidence points strongly in the direction of one.&nbsp; In these cases, you should reject the side that is not supported by evidence - this has nothing to do with ""being closed minded"" or ""not considering the other side.""&nbsp; One should approach scientific questions with an open mind, but one should also be ready to accept viewpoints which run counter to one's pre-established prejudices when scientific evidence challenges them.&nbsp; Holding staunchly to our beliefs when evidence points the other direction is the epitome of having a closed mind, one which is static, unchangeable, and immune to the probings of reality.&nbsp; ",4

2079,1382450611,"This is rather long and I'm no expert, so it probably has a few mistakes. Your question's interesting so I accidentally wrote an essay.There are lots of rules about experimenting on human subjects, for good reason. You have to make sure that you're not putting the participants at unjustifiable risk (if there's any risk you have to be able to explain your reason for thinking this study will benefit people enough to be worth it.) It's considered unethical to compare something to no treatment if there's a better alternative available- for example you should compare a new painkiller to ibuprofen or something rather than sugar pills- or to deny someone an effective treatment they would otherwise get. Now think about this in the context of a randomised controlled trial of vaccines. You're putting both the participants and anyone exposed to them at risk of vaccine-preventible disease. They are, essentially, being denied the standard of care. And you're either telling parents that their children won't get the vaccine or will get the vaccine because you flipped a coin- or else not just letting them know. Now, that's necessary in a randomized controlled trial, but a lot of people might not want to participate in this, and you'll need a large sample size to see if there are any problems with the vaccine. You could also do an observational study, and they have been done&nbsp;(not always well), but there are a few problems with this too. First of all you'll need a lot of participants, especially because the unvaccinated control&nbsp;population is often a lot smaller. Unless whatever you're looking for happens almost all the time you'll need a ton of participants for&nbsp;both- think of the rotovirus vaccine in the most recent lecture, with intussusception in 1 in 10,000 children.&nbsp;You'll also potentially find some differences which are purely by chance, especially if you have fewer people than you should. Then&nbsp;people who vaccinate and people who don't&nbsp;vaccinate may be different in other ways too. People who have&nbsp;expensive cars are probably going to live longer than those who don't, because people who can afford expensive cars are likely to be richer and therefore live longer. It doesn't mean awesome cars extend your lifespan.  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/1/187.fullIn order to do this trial, especially for the RCT, the evidence&nbsp;should say there's a chance that kids getting vaccines or a vaccine might not be better off. So you have to get that evidence first, for vaccines in general, because that's the standard that's been set by people who don't believe in any vaccination- that vaccines, in general, rather than one specific one, are harmful or more harmful than beneficial. Testing one specific vaccine is a whole 'nother kettle of fish and has been done, and is done.",3
132,1378221069,"Dear guys,I am curious about the rabies story in the video,it said that rabbit spinal cord can attenuate the rabies virus, so it can induce immune response in human.That means what Pasteur injected in human body was not an antibody, its an antigen.What confused me is: is it safe or perhaps effective to inject antigen when you already have infected by so-called the wild antigen?&nbsp;I thought that vaccine as an active innate immunization should be given prior to pathogen exposure.Please correct me if I'm wrong",4

When you read about it's eradication you see how it was done, &nbsp;the WHO used Ring vaccination in the end to stop outbreaks from spreading. &nbsp; When someone was discovered with Smallpox then whole areas were vaccinated around the outbreak so that it could not spread. &nbsp; This saved having to vaccinate every single person.The only debate that I can see is whether the last remaining samples of Smallpox in labs should be destroyed or not so that it cannot be used as a biological weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;",2

My sister in law had meningitis as a child and it has left it's mark with some learning difficulties, which while mild have affected her life. Also bear in mind, that by vaccinating my healthy children, I am helping to protect children too young or too seriously unwell to receive the shots, because I'm contributing to herd immunity.

1534,1380115566,"I wanted to share the following news release about the avian flu vaccine since&nbsp;many of you work in the medical field:For Immediate Release: Wednesday, September 18, 2013NIH begins testing H7N9 avian influenza vaccine candidatePossible role for adjuvants to be examinedResearchers at nine sites nationwide have begun testing in humans an investigational H7N9 avian influenza vaccine. The two concurrent Phase II clinical trials, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, are designed to gather critical information about the safety of the candidate vaccine and the immune system responses it induces when administered at different dosages and with or without adjuvants, substances designed to boost the body immune response to vaccination.Human cases of H7N9 influenza first emerged in China in February 2013, with the majority of reported infections occurring in the spring. As of Aug. 12, 135 confirmed human cases, including 44 deaths, have been reported by the World Health Organization. Most of these cases involved people who came into contact with infected poultry. Although no H7N9 influenza cases have been reported outside of China and the virus has not demonstrated sustained person-to-person transmission, there is concern that it could mutate to pose a much greater public health threat.??7N9 avian influenza virus ??like all novel influenza virus strains to which people have not been exposed ??has the potential to cause widespread sickness and mortality,??said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ??e are now testing a vaccine candidate with and without adjuvant in an effort to prepare for and, hopefully, protect against this possibility.??/p>The two clinical trials, which will enroll healthy adults ages 19 to 64, will evaluate an investigational H7N9 vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur. The candidate vaccine was made from inactivated H7N9 virus isolated in Shanghai, China in 2013. Adjuvants are being tested with the investigational vaccine because previous vaccine research involving other H7 influenza viruses has suggested that two doses of vaccine without adjuvant may not produce an immune response adequate to provide effective protection. In pandemic situations, adjuvants also can be used as part of a dose-sparing strategy, which would allow production of more doses of vaccine from the available supply of the viral antigen, thereby allowing a greater number of people to be vaccinated more quickly.The first clinical trial, led by Mark J. Mulligan, M.D., of Emory University in Atlanta, will enroll as many as 700 study participants who will be randomly assigned to one of seven groups (up to 100 participants in each group). Each group will receive two equivalent dosages (3.75 micrograms [mcg], 7.5 mcg, 15 mcg or 45 mcg) of the candidate vaccine, approximately 21 days apart. Five of the groups will receive the vaccinations along with MF59 adjuvant, developed by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics.Of these five groups, three will receive adjuvant with both vaccinations; one group of participants will receive adjuvant only with the first vaccination; and another group of participants will receive adjuvant only with the second vaccination. Two groups of participants will not receive adjuvant. The MF59 adjuvant that is being tested is also contained in the Fluad seasonal influenza vaccine currently licensed in Europe and Canada for use in people age 65 years or older.The second trial, led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., M.P.H., of Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, will enroll as many as 1,000 participants. Each participant will be randomly assigned to one of 10 groups (up to 100 participants per group) and will receive two equivalent doses (same dosages as the other trial) of the investigational H7N9 vaccine given 21 days apart.Seven of these groups will receive the vaccinations either with or without AS03 adjuvant, developed by GlaxoSmithKline Biologics. Two groups will receive their first vaccination with AS03 or MF59 adjuvant and then receive the alternate adjuvant at time of second vaccination. One group will receive the MF59 adjuvant at both vaccinations. The AS03 adjuvant that is being tested was used in a 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, Pandemrix, used in several European countries during the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic.In both studies, which are expected to conclude in December 2014, a panel of independent experts will closely monitor safety data at regular intervals throughout the trial.The vaccine studies are being conducted at the eight NIAID-funded Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; Children?? Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati; Emory University, Atlanta; Group Health Cooperative, Seattle; Saint Louis University, St. Louis; University of Iowa, Iowa City; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore; and Vanderbilt University, Nashville. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston will conduct the trial as a subcontractor to Baylor College of Medicine.Further information about both clinical trials can be found at&nbsp;http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov&nbsp;using the identifiers:NCT01938742&nbsp;and&nbsp;NCT01942265.For more information, visit&nbsp;NIAID?? Influenza Web portal. For U.S. government information on avian and pandemic influenza, see&nbsp;http://www.Flu.gov&nbsp;.NIAID conducts and supports research ??at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide ??to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

1557,1380195714,"Vaccination and immunization are the same thing. &nbsp;Vaccination/immunization results in and active immune response - this can only happen when the body (immune system) is in contact with an antigen that invokes an immune response, so either a vaccine, virus, bacteria, etc etc. &nbsp;Passive immunity is what is obtained when mothers breast-feed their babies, for example, which passes antibodies to them. &nbsp;This only infers immunity for a short period of time, and the baby is required to build up their own antibodies, which is only done by coming into contact with the antigen. &nbsp;So, a mother could pass some short-term immunity to her baby by breast-feeding, which will keep the baby protected until it receives it's vaccination...or until it comes in contact with the disease, whichever comes first.",2

1254,1379346621,"The last I heard, D.O. were still not allowed
to be licensed as physicians in Canada.&nbsp; 

I spent most of my childhood in a small town in
[REDACTED] ]where we had three hospitals ?two for the MDs and one for the Dos.&nbsp; We went to both.&nbsp; The osteopathic hospital functioned basically
just like the other two, except that the DOs also knew how to perform
manipulations. Since I was just a kid at the time, I didnt really know what
the difference was between these two types of doctors.&nbsp; When I was 8 my mother took a job as the
reception in the office of an MD who was also the county health officer who
could not hide distain for DOs, even referring to them as ??r.??nbsp; Now the town just has one hospital and I
think MDs and DOs work side by side.

When I was 15 I moved to [REDACTED] which
was just in the process of recognizing DOs. I recall one of my high school
teachers warning us that a new doctor in the area was a DO (i.e. not a real doctor.)&nbsp; Based on my family experience,
that sounded odd to me.&nbsp; About 13 years
later, I took a job as an EEG tech. in a hospital located in logging town near
the [REDACTED] &nbsp; It had both MDs
and DOs, but I soon got the impression that the DOs were still the new kids on
the block, and not accepted by everyone, including my supervisor ??until she
finally got up the courage to let one of them use manipulations to treat her
aching neck.&nbsp; She had a much more
positive attitude towards DOs after that.&nbsp;
Another DO there was an orthopedic surgeon.&nbsp; He removed two of my bunions and did a great
job.&nbsp; Now in the U.S., DOs specialize in
every major field of medicine just like MDs. ( In fact, some would complain
that theye become to much like MDs, perhaps having overly embraced the
allopathic treatments and forgetting some other their more holistic osteopathic
roots. 

DOs may obtain a license by passing the Osteopathic
Medicine board exams but many also take all the levels of the USMLE (taken by
MDs) so that they may undergo residencies in large medical centers.&nbsp; Now some of the osteopathic medical schools
are even attached to state universities in states as diverse as Texas, Oklahoma,
Florida, and Ohio.&nbsp; Most such schools are
private.&nbsp; Many of their grads set up
practice in areas where there is a shortage of physicians. Many patients prefer
DOs to MDs as their primary care physician because they tend to look at the
patient condition from a more holistic perspective, and often have a much
better bedside manner than MDs.&nbsp; If I
were interested in training as a physician, I?? much rather become a DO than
and MD.

Mercola, by the way, is the only DO I
personally have ever heard of who markets health products.&nbsp; Again, I included his article because of its
information about the revolving door relationship between US government health
agencies and big Pharma.&nbsp; I think that
this problem and the freedom manufactures of alternative treatments have to
make unsubstantiated claims have the same root cause, namely the excessive
corporate power that is so prevalent in the U.S. Alternative medicine
manufacturers tend to be careful in complying with the FDA?? restriction that
they not claim that their products actually cure any diseases.&nbsp; So, instead they just say, for example, that
their products support hair growth, or support the immune system.&nbsp; Of course even claims such as these should be
substantiated.&nbsp; The real tragedy here is
twofold.&nbsp; First, thousands (or millions)
of people throw away their hard-earned money on products that aren?? going to
help them.&nbsp; Secondly, by not routinely
testing alternative treatments, we fail to find out which ones actually work
and, according, which ones it?? actually worthwhile for patients to spend their
money and place their hopes.&nbsp; The end
result is that extremists on both ends (allopathic and alternative
practitioners) may unfairly slander each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I personally am encouraged to see more and more
integrative medicine clinics popping up at places like the Univ. of Bridgeport,
the Univ. of Arizona (under Andrew Weil, M.D.) and, I think also at U.C. San
Francisco School of Medicine.&nbsp; However,
whatever wonderful treatments they uncover must be thoroughly tested by
qualified experts who do not stand to gain from their licensing by the FDA or
their subsequent marketing.&nbsp; Otherwise,
the result would be far worse for consumers than what they have now, because at
least now, most understand that it?? a buyer-beware
jungle out there.&nbsp; If unscrupulous
alternative treatment docs and marketers were able to financially influence or
speed-up the FDA approval process of their products and treatments, then the
public (at least initially) might not be aware that the buyer-beware jungle would not have gone away, but rather would only
have been cleverly cloaked in official approval. Yes, we??e been there and done
that before, haven?? we?",2

660,1378415475,"Hi, I am a Public Health Nurse working in [REDACTED](about to spend a year working in [REDACTED]).Professor [REDACTED]'s first lecture stated that if you are allergic to egg, this may be a reason to consider NOT getting the Influenza vaccine.&nbsp; We always ask about egg allergy prior to giving Influenza vaccine to anyone because of this concern, as the vaccine is made inside eggs, and there is a potential for some residual egg protein to remain in the vaccine.This year Australia released a new Immunisation Handbook for vaccine providers, and in this book it states:A history of anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction to eggs has 
previously been considered an absolute contraindication to influenza 
vaccination. However, there have now been a number of studies indicating
 that the majority of persons with egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, 
can be safely vaccinated with influenza vaccines that contain less than 1
 g of ovalbumin per dose8-10(see 4.7 Influenza).
The majority of vaccine-associated anaphylaxis cases reported as 
likely due to egg allergy occurred following administration of one of 
the older formulations of influenza vaccine.9
 Today, due to manufacturing changes, the quantity of egg ovalbumin 
present in the majority of influenza vaccines used in Australia is less 
than 1 ?g of ovalbumin per dose.8
 Note that the amount of residual egg ovalbumin may vary from year to 
year due to manufacturing processes, vaccine batches and country of 
origin. The PI of the vaccine to be given should be checked for the 
vaccine?? ovalbumin content prior to vaccine administration.8,9,11,12 
Given that there is still a small risk of anaphylaxis, it is 
essential that persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction to 
eggs are vaccinated in facilities that have staff who are able to 
recognise and treat anaphylaxis.8,9
 Allergy testing (e.g. skin testing) with influenza vaccine prior to 
administration is not recommended, as there is poor correlation between 
test results and vaccine tolerance.8,9

Dysfunctional immunity and impaired brain function are core deficits in ASD. Aluminum (Al), the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, is a demonstrated neurotoxin and a strong immune stimulator. Hence, adjuvant Al has the potential to induce neuroimmune disorders. When assessing adjuvant toxicity in children, two key points ought to be considered: (i) children should not be viewed as ""small adults"" as their unique physiology makes them much more vulnerable to toxic insults; and (ii) if exposure to Al from only few vaccines can lead to cognitive impairment and autoimmunity in adults, is it unreasonable to question whether the current pediatric schedules, often containing 18 Al adjuvanted vaccines, are safe for children? By applying Hill's criteria for establishing causality between exposure and outcome we investigated whether exposure to Al from vaccines could be contributing to the rise in ASD prevalence in the Western world. Our results show that: (i) children from countries with the highest ASD prevalence appear to have the highest exposure to Al from vaccines; (ii) the increase in exposure to Al adjuvants significantly correlates with the increase in ASD prevalence in the United States observed over the last two decades (Pearson r=0.92, p&lt;0.0001); and (iii) a significant correlation exists between the amounts of Al administered to preschool children and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries, particularly at 3-4 months of age (Pearson r=0.89-0.94, p=0.0018-0.0248). The application of the Hill's criteria to these data indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be causal. Because children represent a fraction of the population most at risk for complications following exposure to Al, a more rigorous evaluation of Al adjuvant safety seems warranted.",2

386,1378266618,"Rotavirus rates fell in adults, too, after vaccineTuesday, August 27, 2013Related MedlinePlus PagesChildhood ImmunizationRotavirus InfectionsBy Genevra PittmanNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Fewer older children and adults were hospitalized for severe diarrhea once the U.S. started vaccinating babies against rotavirus in 2006, according to a new study.Rotavirus is one cause of the ""stomach flu,"" or gastroenteritis, and introduction of the rotavirus vaccine has already been tied to a drop in related hospitalizations among preschoolers. But whether vaccinating babies would also confer protection for older people was unclear, researchers said.""This study confirms the benefits of the rotavirus vaccine program, but it also shows there's an unexpected benefit to the population at large,"" Ben Lopman, who worked on the study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.""This is one example of what we call herd immunity,"" he told Reuters Health.""By vaccinating young children you prevent them from getting sick, but you also prevent them from transmitting (rotavirus) to their siblings and their parents.""The initial rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the U.S. in 1998 and pulled the following year due to concerns it might cause blocked bowels in babies.Newer versions, which are given orally, became routine in 2007. Pre- and post-release testing of those vaccines has not shown those same side effects (see Reuters Health story of January 5, 2012 here: http://reut.rs/AAe8bT).For their study, the CDC researchers compared data on a nationally-representative sample of hospital stays by children and adults diagnosed with rotavirus or unspecified gastroenteritis in 2000-2006 and 2008-2010.Rotavirus testing is rarely performed in adults, they noted, so many more unspecified gastroenteritis cases were included.As previous studies have shown, rotavirus rates among young children dropped after the start of vaccination; there were 80 percent fewer discharges for rotavirus among kids under five in the post-vaccine study years than in pre-vaccine years.Rotavirus-related discharges also dropped by 70 percent for children aged five to 14, by 53 percent for 15- to 24-year-olds and by 43 percent among adults aged 25 to 44.Likewise, discharges for cause-unspecified gastroenteritis fell by 30 percent among five- to 14-year-olds after 2007, by 11 percent among teenagers and young adults and by six percent for adults under 45.Although it's not clear how many of those unspecified cases were caused by rotavirus, reductions were primarily seen in March and April - the peak months for rotavirus hospitalizations before the vaccine, the researchers wrote Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.""The pattern that we've seen after the introduction of vaccines is very consistent,"" Lopman said.He said prior estimates showed between 55,000 and 70,000 young children were hospitalized for rotavirus every year before 2006.""The benefits of the vaccine have been demonstrated time and again,"" he said.""Increasing vaccine coverage could bring even more benefit from what has occurred to date.""SOURCE: http://bit.ly/MvXYT6 Journal of the American Medical Association, online August 27, 2013.",2

Breast milk provides a supplemental immune system to those receiving it. In a normal (as normal for our species) human life one would be breast fed typically for the first 4-7 years of age which is not common in most countries at this point. Breast milk also affects the normal flora that develops in the intestinal tract, which we are now in medicine, just starting to understand why that would affect immune function and how.",3

This suspicion led to concern about exposure to aluminum through everyday sources such as pots and pans, beverage cans, antacids and antiperspirants. Since then, studies have failed to confirm any role for aluminum in causing Alzheimer. Experts today focus on other areas of research, and few believe that everyday sources of aluminum pose any threat.No link was found. &nbsp;As for researching aluminum in vaccines, I did a quick PubMed search and found 2140 matching articles.
