Clearly, you were way ahead of me this morning!My family was not really into anything nerdy when I was growing up (probably the opposite, actually). But I read CS Lewis when I was itty bitty, found Frank L. Baum after that, followed by Tolkien shortly thereafter. It was all down hill from there! Asimov and McCaffrey were also on the list of authors I got into in middle school. I was a ravenous bookworm once I was old enough to read (I even went as a bookworm for halloween one year). Before high school I consumed nerdy stuff almost exclusively via books, but added art and television/movies shortly after I got there. And rpg's (no kids for me yet, but I do have several friends who do have them, they're usually around while we game, since we only meet up once every month-ish, though as they grow older we'll probably have to make the games a bit more kid-friendly when they want to join in) after that and into college (where I joined the Science Fiction and Fantasy Guild while I pursued my art degree for graphic design!)Not into supernatural (yet), only caught a couple of episodes here or there and didn't like them much. But that was the same impression I had of Buffy before I sat down and watched it from beginning to end, so I've hardly passed judgement on it. I think we may start watching it later this year, after most of the tv shows we dvr go on break!&nbsp;I watch Castle mostly for Nathan Fillion, though I do really like the actors playing his mother and daughter as well!

2740,1368260168,"I try to use open source software when possible, but I have to concede that there is some merit in using a free download of Adobe Photoshop CS2 (which is not the latest version) from a software site like Techspot or from Adobe itself (where you can also get several other Adobe CS2 products free) You may have to use Adobe on some future project, and the skills you learn are fairly readily transferable to other products, because others generally tend to model on Adobe, the market leader, not vice versa.I actually prefer PAINTshop Pro (which I have been using ~18 years, from its introduction by JASC in the 90s through its buyout by Corel) For well over a decade, Paintshop worked faster on Intel machines than the originally Mac-based (Motorola CPU) Photoshop, which was only *ported* to Intel. That's changed a bit since Apple went Intel -- but older Intel (Windows) computers will still run Paintshop faster than PhotoshopI just checked Adobe's page, and after millions of downloads this past month, they have now&nbsp; added a dissuasive message that wasn't there last month.&nbsp; Please note that though they ""strongly advise"" against using outdated software [""PAY for our new stuff instead""], it's legal enough that 100% legitimate commercial software sites are re-distributing it! -- and frankly, given Adobe's long history of security bugs, which were worked out of CS2 over years-log reign as ""the current version"", it may be safer than CS6+. I still prefer to use MS Office 95 (the last version before they introduced macros, which were a major source of security problems for the next decade) on my personal computers, even my work has given me all the later Office versions (""assure compatibility with our current version""). I've always been a techie-type but I honestly never miss any of the ""new"" features (only&nbsp; professional Office users even *know* about 90% of the new features since Office95) I much prefer the interface (from the days when MS was still working on increasing usability rather than justifying a new edition for a fresh revenue stream) and I'm safer.",2

mind, but is widescreen HD (1920x1080) rather than the older 4:3 format
(1600x1200), and their liquidation arm (Cowboom) which was selling them
""refurbished"" (they never admit it's unsold stock) for $8 for a few years, has
apparently sold off all their old stock.

I'm sure other suitable candidates exist (the WEB2C came out in 2008),
but if I can find 100 WEB2Cs for my first model, I'll grab them. I have
emails out to sellers who seem to have stock. 100 isn't such a big order.
It would have been easy to fill 1-2 years ago, but times move fast &amp;
warehouse space isn't free..

I've got some emails out to fabricators, and am working on designs suitable
for prototyping on Ponoko (primarily beause I know their site/materials
the best, and have long wanted to use them) If you haven't read Professor [REDACTED]'s blog, e.g  his article on using Ponoko to fabricate the media shelf or  bike seat he described in lecture,
you probably should -- every tidbit helps, right?

Sadly, I can no longer avoid learning a good 3-D design program -- without
specs, I can't get meaningful quotes. I've mastered many other technical
programs in the past, but it's always been a significant time investment.
I can only hope that having a specific project makes it easier to learn.
It usually does.

The cash investment isn't a problem for me, though I've always been frugal
by nature (indeed, that's partly why I have the cash to throw around).
A 4-credit course at any local college, even a community college, that
offers hands-on experience designing, building, managing and selling would
likely set me back at least $2000 after all the fees were included.
A production run of 100 shouldn't cost more than $4000 (less for a partial
kit) and I'll make part or all of it back, even if I don't sell out the
run. So the cost is likely to be less than a course, and the experience
will be unarguably real, not academic.

I just wish it *were* a course, so I could have you all to moan to, when
things get rough!
