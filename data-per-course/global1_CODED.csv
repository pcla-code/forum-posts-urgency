By its very nature the western democracies have become a playground for lobbyists, industry interests and conspiracies that have absolutely no interest in real democracy. The ""democracy show"" must go on nonetheless. Conveniently, the show consumes the energy of those that might otherwise become dangerous to the status quo. The show provides the necessary excuse when things go wrong and keeps up the illusion of participation.

Article here.
edit: This sentence is, in my opinion, very important;

Presenting the problem to the population as a mutually exclusive choice between an uncertain dangerous freedom and an assured survival under the securing umbrella of the trustworthy state becomes more easy the further the various crises develop. 

Think about how the last 3 problems in your country (i.e. military buying new weapons, introducing a new tax) or in the world (i.e. coup d'etat in Thailand, Syrian army taking over Aleppo) were presented to you. 
Then pick one and spend an hour reading online about it. Don't read the usual scripts. Go to twitter.com/search, find personal blogs of people who are closely related to that problems, search youtube, vimeo, liveleak etc. 
The danger of the 60-year-old bureaucrat will become clearer.

I highly recommend you look at the work Thomas Piketty has been doing (his book Capital in the Twenty First Century investigates the mechanisms behind levels of inequality.I think there are a lot of factors that would influence optimal inequality, including rates of growth as one commenter suggested, but also different social characteristics (a more income unequal society might be fine if families are especially integrated and support one another, or high rates of charitable giving).Piketty's basic set of policy tools to prevent huge wealth and income inequality is by making finance more transparent (basically by making it clear who owns what) and instituting progressive wealth and estate taxes. These taxes would prevent the biggest fortunes from continuing to grow disproportionately faster than the economy as a whole.It's worth looking at the work of Wilkinson and Pickett in The Spirit Level also. They discuss how inequality causes poorer outcomes in all kinds of social indicators, from education, to violence and health.

2666,1400370821,"I'm having the feeling that the way in which urbanization is presented in the lectures/readings is a little unbalanced, as if I'm meant to be left with the impression that urbanization is mostly a bad thing. Here, from The new demography aging, migration, and obesity:

The rapid increase in urbanization and in the size of megacities will place stress on food, water, and sanitation systems around the world.

In this very particular regard, for example, it is very well documented that resources are better managed and handled for peoples and cities than in rural areas, since delivery of services and products is more cost effective in cities; and not surprisingly services such as transportation, gas, water, electricity are normally cheaper in cities since you got a whole lot more people in the same place (see Urban or rural: Which is more energy-efficient?).

It is important to keep in mind that urban dwellers have very different lifestyles than rural inhabitants and that cities account for 80 percent of carbon emissions.

Well, this is an unfair comparison because many industries, alongside with people, are located in metropolitan areas; and again, on a per capita basis, you bet a family on a rural area burning logs emits a whole lot more $$CO_2$$ than the same family on an apartment using the central heating of a building (see Electricity Consumption in Rural vs. Urban Areas).
And let alone, that people in cities have better access to education with is also proved to play a key factor in fertility rates.
Cities carry a whole lot of problems, some of which were presented (such as pollution, stress, etc), but unto this particular discussion, I think it's people who put stress on food, water, sanitation... not cities; if anything, cities under proper management offer in fact a relief to this stress until some extend, stress that could otherwise be bigger provided you got the same amount of people on a more spread area, less educated and having more children.

But the alarming aspect is not just the economic implications of the erosion of the middle class, it is also the political ramifications. If the middle class continues to be eroded in the most democratic zones of the world, what will that entail and how will that make the persistence of income inequality ever more acute?

This is more so in traditional economies where the influence of ""plastic"" (Credit card) are on the increase in tune with the urbanization. ??This leads to the following interesting questions:a) What kind of challenges will organisations, particularly Engineering &amp; manufacturing (more traditional compared to service sector) do you envisage while handling Generation Y &amp; Z workforce.?b) What kind of strategies the banking system should evolve to boost savings (assuming savings is good and need to be encouraged for the economy to grow)?c) Do we continue to deal with ""plastic money"" or are there alternates anticipated?Your views are welcome",3

1828,1399806167,"1. What is the most striking piece of information in lecture 1?As stated in Lecture 1, globalisation makes the world more interrelated than ever before. Regardless of this interconnectedness, there are still many serious issues in all walks of life- economic, social, political, demographic, etc. In my opinion, the most striking piece of information is that globalisation does not remedy our problems, it actually sharps them. For instance, people produce artificially more food than ever, but it is still not fairly allocated even though the highest level of development of logistics and distribution. Moreover, developing countries catch up with developed countries to a certain extent, but inequality within the nations is higher today. Yet another striking example is that we all have access to any kind of information through mass media or the Internet but uncertainty in our reality is deeper. Last but not least, environmental detriment ion is still a topical issue. So, the first lesson is learnt! Thank you for the well-organised Lecture 1. 2. In reading 1, inequality, environment, sustainability, and several other factors are discussed. In your country, which of these seems to be the most popular cause, and why? I am originally from [REDACTED]. Unfortunately, we struggle with all problems discussed in Lecture 1. As far as I am concerned, the most serious issue is social inequality and the huge gap between the poor and the rich. The lack of well-educated middle-class is detrimental for each society and it entails diverse problems- cultural, ethics as well as economic and political.?? ??3. Compared to the United States, the economic standing of many emerging economies is rising. Is this a bad thing? If so, why? There are many pros and cons against the economic rising of the ??merging markets. In my opinion, the war for power was, is still and will be in the future extremely cruel regardless of the participants. The switch of the leading roles is somehow natural. As stated in Lecture 1, we live in G-zero world with no dominant country or bloc of countries. Ceteris paribus, the equilibrium between the super powers leads to development based on greater competition. However, we are witnessing the results of unfair competition every day- the price of the economic rise of the emerging markets is high. They are the greatest pollutants according to the World Health Organisation. Meanwhile, the United States predominant role has lasted too long. Undoubtedly, the United States brought to the world some of the greatest inventions and the American democracy is an outstanding example but the war in Afghanistan will not be forgotten. In conclusion, the controversial 21st century we live in, will continue to amaze and challenge us.",2

Nice posts. We all agree that countries are less prone to disputes than others
states and that hostility between trade block members are less likely to occur
as trade flows raise between them. First Argument is that by increasing contact
among traders and consumers located in various countries, free trade fosters a
sense of international community as well as the development of mutual respect
and harmonious relations that reduce inter- states tensions. Second Argument is
that unfettered commerce dampens political conflict by promoting economic
dependence. Liberal trade encourages specialization in the production of good
and services, rendering private traders and consumers dependent on foreign
markets. These Actors have an incentive to avoid wars with key trading
partners, since any disruption in commercial relations stemming from
hostilities would be costly. Governments, which have reasons to respond to
demands made by constituents and to enhance a country?â‚¬?s economic performance,
face similar incentives. States have political reasons to minimize their
dependence on foreign commerce and that military expansion offers one way to
achieve this end. Hence, as trade flows and the extent of interdependence
increase, so do the incentives for states to take military actions to reduce
their economic vulnerability. Furthermore, as commerce rises, so do the range
of economic issues over which disputes can emerge.
?â‚¬?International hostilities are primarily attributable to variations inn the
distribution of political military capabilities among states.?â‚¬?
?â‚¬?Higher level of trade dampens conflict?â‚¬?.

The intergovernmental panel on climate change in September 2013 raised the probability that global warming is man-made from 90% to 95%. That is very close to consensus from the scientific community. The panel also urged for swift action by governments and industry, saying global warming poses a growing threat to the health, economic rospects and food and water sourcesof billions of people.If there is disagreement, it is coming from conservative politicians and the fossil fuel industry that funds them.

3174,1400845650,"Thank you for this read. This was worth much indeed. There are a few highlights that I'd like to point out from this article that would help the reader to form a more idealistic perspective about the Indian Nation.First of all, India is a hard Nation to govern. much has to do with the vast variety of social, religious and other diversities that are found within the country, including the differentiation of language. Perhaps the only country with a vast variety of languages spoken within its boundaries, India is sub-divided into different states based on language. For the ideal governance, much power is given to these sates, as such to govern a country of such magnitude with respect to language, caste, religion, ethnicity and race is no easy task.Next and perhaps the most weighing of all aspects is the stark contrast between the metropolitan cities which are few in number and the vast majority of the rural areas. There are differences with regard to income disparity, allocation of resources, government policies between the two and so on. It is quite next to impossible to implement policies for growth and development equally in the cities and in the rural areas taking into consideration the sheer size on the and volume of the landmass and population of India.This being said however, the Indian people have voted for a new government during this voting season and a much awaited change from the UPA led congress party that has been piloting the government policies for the last decade. Here we have a fresh government under the leader ship of Mr.Modi who is expected to devote the strength of his office and power to the development and progress of India and its economy. There is definitely going to be a change in the outlook as compared to past decade. This was evident in the stock market boom that India witnessed during the close of the elections.I am not one for speculations, but I am sure that a lot of unexpected event are to unfold during his tenure as PM. To name a few, there is going to be a rise in the FDI for a start. Infrastructure will see a new start and generate much employment. Much of the new policies will focus on reducing the income disparity with the country and fresh bi-lateral talks will be on the table. Just sit back and relax, see a new India unfold.",2
3753,1401554388,"The US Dollar is the reserve currency because people and corporations in other countries want to sell goods and services to the US. Every country and every corporation are free to sell their stuff to sources in any country of their choosing and are free in that contract to choose the currency in which they want to use for that transaction. There is no world authority that requires the the US Dollar be used in these transactions.??So why do people in other countries choose the US Dollar. Well if you want to sell anything to the US, the company in the US that is buying it wants the transaction to be in US dollars so they can compare the price against offers within the US which will be paid in US Dollars. So why would two countries, neither of which are the US want a transaction to be in US dollars. Simply because neither of the companies in those countries want to use the currency from the other country so they agree upon a third party country which turns out to be the US because both companies are already doing business with the US and are used to trading in that currency.So how about China? Well China really wants to sell stuff to the US and is happy to be paid in US dollars so they can go to Africa and buy stuff like minerals and take the US dollars they got from the US and give it to Africa.The US doesn't tell countries to trade in US dollars, they do it because it simplifies their transactions.If China gets around to buying more stuff from the rest of the world than they sell to the US then maybe they will insist on the currency of those transaction being in rinminbi's.??If the Chinese want to sell something to a member of the Euro Zone, the buyer can insist that the transaction must be in Euro's and the Chinese will then calculate the price.

In low income suburbs, policemen and offenders live along the same streets, just a few houses away from each other. If policemen arrest offenders, their families are in extreme danger. So, instead, they are forced to deal with them.

1979,1399898712,"Why is African population increasing?I think, based on the experience of more developed countries, that having many children is a cultural behaviour mainly due to:- High early-birth mortality (if a lot of children are dieing, parents try to make more children)- No pension system (if there is no pension system, sons could take care of their old parents).BTW, I agree that??Africa growth population is not a disadvantage and could will be a great driver for development. It could be disruptive for other economies that take the raw materials form that continent.??",2
