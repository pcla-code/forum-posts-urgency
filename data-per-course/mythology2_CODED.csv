Ever since Immanuel Velikovsky's 'Worlds in Collision' written in 1950 and Erich Von DÃƒÂ¤niken's 'Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past' written in 1968 (which I loved as a child) the 'ancient astronaut' theory based on a particular interpretation of certain ancient myths has been incredibly and enduringly popular in films and TV (for example Stargate ).What I find fascinating is how these books and others really caught the publicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imagination.

4897,1407019734,"OK, maybe I've been a bit obsessive about looking into this...
I've now found a couple of references that state the shoulder of a sacrificial animal was the portion of the king - which fits with a 'shoulder' being given to Pelops by the goddess Demeter, and his own future status as king.
It can also relate to the ability to carry (shoulder) something - the power and strength to 'bring into being' - kingly characteristics; and apt for Pelops bringing the Peloponnesus Kingdom into being (he is an ancestral figure).
Not completely sure about ivory - the link with falsehood doesn't really seem to fit with kingly power?
However, I've come across another source (Dictionary of Symbols) which quotes Pliny as saying 'Ivory preserves the body from all decay'. This seems to fit better with Demeter, who is linked with fertility and life.
So - maybe a functionalist myth, legitimising the self-image of Pelops' descendants: a kingdom and dynasty, blessed by the gods, which will not decay
Unfortunately, things changed as time went on...

However, when we do compare him to Homer, it seems as if Homer wasn't quite as hampered by this artistic limitation. In this sense, doesn't it seem as if Homer was perhaps truer to his vision than Vergil? Homer seemed to ""write,"" or rather recite, to entertain and transmit certain values, but he wasn't doing it to serve one particular emperor.

In Book 11, Odysseus also learns from his mother that Penelope has not remarried and is waiting for him. Wouldn't she have warned Odysseus if Penelope was plotting against him? I suspect that Odysseus had no worries about Penelope's loyalty but perhaps he was concerned that if he came home openly that the suitors would kill Penelope and seize his property and position?And from the point of view that it is an epic, it would be a bit of a damp squid if Odysseus just went home openly, looked sternly at the suitors and the suitors said, ""Ooops, sorry pal, here's some money and sheep, we're going sorry!""I do agree to a large extent that Odysseus is a bit of a plonker (for example, telling the cyclops his name and address!).

These figures represent all sorts and shapes of the female form, not all what we may consider conventionally attractive.With the advent of farming maybe there was a tension between the need to control and utilise ""Mother Earth"" to grow crops etc and a grudging respect for the vagaries with which the earth treated the farmer, some years granting a good harvest at other times not so much. There may have also been a sense that there was often a conflict Ã‚Â between the sky which produced rain and wind and the fertility of the Earth.Ã‚Â I wonder if the Creation myths reflect a sense of these conflicts and tensions, which perhaps became more of a concern for the early farmers who were developing a closer, perhaps it could be said a working relationship with Earth than the hunter-gather.Ã‚Â ",2

1599,1403043076,"All right. I'm going there....where even Homer seems to fear to tread....Here's a different reading of Penelope which I can't get out of my head, and which is based on a close reading of these 1st 8 books in the Fagles translation. I'm not at all claiming that it's ""right"" - I don't think such a thing ever exists in the interpretation of poetry, it's simply my reading of the words. It's more an exploration than an interpretation, I suppose.The suitors are described, again and again, as eating and drinking Odysseus's (and Telemachus's) entire household contents:Page 84-85 Athena speaks:""What's this banqueting....Some wedding-feast, some festival?....Hardly a potluck supper, I would say.....gorging in your house.""But we all know the topic of conversation here -- it's not a problem with food supply, it's sexual politics. A wedding-feast (as so aptly mentioned by Athena) points to a wedding bed and consensual sex...love. The sex which may or may not be happening in Odysseus's house while he is away is about power and lust - appetite, not love.What is Telemachus's view of his mother's sexuality?He brings her fidelity into question several times:Page 84, line 249 ""Mother has always told me I'm his son, it's true, but I am not so certain.""Page 85, line 289 ""And Mother...she neither rejects a marriage she despises nor can she bear to bring the courting to an end - while they continue to bleed my household white.""Although in public he sticks to the respectful line, page 95, line 55 ""Suitors plague my mother - against her will -""Then, look at his words to Penelope on page 88, line 400:""Bards are not to blame --Zeus is to blame.""Hmmm....the fact that Homer (?) Fagles (?) split that line makes me wonder if Telemachus was about to blame his mother, but then remembered where he was and did a quick switch to Zeus. In any case, Penelope ""took to heart the clear good sense in what her son had said."" and Homer then describes him as ""discreet Telemachus"".Does Penelope blame herself as well??But Telemachus is young, naive and confused. He has no father to guide him and teach him what is right or wrong in the treatment of women, so we need to keep that in mind.The suitors, of course, blame Penelope and label her ""the matchless queen of cunning"", but we can't take that seriously....sounds like an excuse for bad behaviour (although, granted, that's coming from the perspective of 2014).***However, the following is very serious indeed:Page 96, line 120: ""we caught her in the act - unweaving her gorgeous web. So she finished it off. Against her will. We forced her.""Penelope weaves TOWARDS something, towards Laertes' death (as she's making his shroud). What does that mean? If she accepts one of the suitors, it is a proclamation of Odysseus's death and would kill Laertes...perhaps?But wait.....she's also weaving TOWARDS having sex with a man other than her husband, another kind of death - death of marriage, death of Laertes' royal line (?), and a different death altogether -- sexual, appetitious and something more akin to Calypso's life than Penelope's.But it all comes to a startling, horrifying end. The men ""finished it off"". My blood runs cold at those words. Was she raped? What else could that line refer to? And so is the problem now that, even after being raped, she still refuses to marry one of them?",3

Regarding the efforts of translations: language is a living thing it evolves with the times and the culture. The work of the translator is not merely to translate literally, but to make the words come alive to the present day reader while maintaining the spirit, rhyme, meaning, and power of the original. In other words to make it important to you, 3 thousand years later as it was to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. Yes, these works were written a long time ago and have entered the public domain, however, it is the original Greek and Latin that are in the public domain and probably any translations that were published before 1923. 
It takes considerable effort, education, time, and a love of ancient languages to bring us the beauty and raw drama of the past. Everyone, I think will admit some translations are better than others. Shouldn't we support the authors that puts in the most effort at helping us understand such important works? Isn't this worth a few dollars?

3362,1404841358,"I must admit that I'm getting puzzled.  
As I've understood it so far, structuralism is about a core binary underpinning a myth - producing an overarching theme. Such themes are also of fundamental importance relating to basic biology or survival, as these are core concerns of humans.
However, they are surely going to be expressed in a way that emphasises the particular core values, beliefs and concerns of the intended audience - that is, functionalism.
And the particular core values, beliefs and concerns of the intended audience are in turn built upon general factors of fundamental human importance relating to basic biology or survival - that is, structuralism.
And both in turn are best understood by knowing and understanding the context of the time and of the people concerned.  There are some universal myths and widespread motifs, but often if we don't know or understand the history, geography, lifeways etc of the people we run a real risk of totally misunderstanding the meanings. 
This all seems a circular process.  I'm not at all sure we can separate functionalism and structuralism - what do others think?

4661,1406589653,"a couple of thoughts on reading the Eumenides:
Athena declares the issue of determining the guilt or otherwise of Orestes to be too big a problem for her, as either 'solution' could be potentially disastrous in the long run - so she hands it over to humans (albeit retaining a casting vote). Could this be a sign of increasing self-confidence of the Athenian humans, not needing the gods quite so much?
Once traditional blood-feuds are 'officially' disallowed, in favour of the open trials initiated by Athena, steps need to be taken to fully imbed the new order. Without this step, blood feuds would simply go 'underground', ie carry on unofficially, with disastrous consequences for society as a whole - reflected in the Furies' threats to go underground and destroy the life-giving seeds and plants from below the earth.
It's interesting that Athena draws on female principles to prevent this. The new, positive, life-giving energies of the Furies (now the Kindly Ones) are strongly related to the female, and it is women who are called upon in the play's climax to honour this. It seems that human women are being called upon to force society to move away from old and essentially self-destructive blood-feuds, in favour of the new kind of justice.
The sense that bloodshed could continue abroad, away from the homeland, seems both a sop to potentially aggressive males, and also an acknowledgment that bloodlust cannot be totally wiped out - only controlled as well as it can be, and totally forbidden at 'home', ie within the city and state.

I want from you that which is rightfully mine - your loyalty, your tribute, and your worship. 
Dr. McCoy:
May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship? 
Apollo:
Life in paradise. ------

I would have cherished you, cared for you. I would have loved you as a father loves his children. Did I ask so much?

men.
  I am the son of Zeus; Apollo is my name: but you I brought here over

my rich temple that is greatly honored among men, and you shall know the

haste and do as I say. First loose the sheets and lower the sail, and 
then draw the swift ship up upon the land. Take out your goods and the

upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin,

 Delphinius and overlooking for ever. Afterwards, sup beside your dark ship and pour an offering to the blessed gods who dwell on Olympus. But when you have put away craving for sweet food,

4816,1406846993,"OK, thinking out loud, but here goes:
The Oedipus story seems much older than Sophocles.  If I remember rightly, Oedipus is mentioned by Homer as having committed incest with his mother, whose name was given there as similar to that of Jocasta.  However, that Oedipus did not come to disaster, but continued to rule long and well.
Taken together with the 'earth-born' aspects, I wonder if the 'incest' was originally a sacred 'marriage' between the King and (a representative of) the (mother) goddess, to ensure the fertility of the land.
Such 'sacred marriages' are attested in a number of early cultures, including ancient Egypt, although details vary. 
If so, it's easy to see how later cultures, who no longer practise this ritual, could have misinterpreted old stories of such 'sacred marriages' as actual human incest, between the king and his human mother, rather than (the representative of) the mother goddess. It would also explain why Oedipus, despite his blindness, is regarded as inherently good. 
Currently, I'm thinking Sophocles took an old myth (plus other mythic elements), and applied them to suit the contemporary situation in Athens (such as the aftermath of plague).
As for Laius, the confrontation at the crossroads could reflect a power struggle between an aged king, and a potential new claimant; neither prepared to give way to the other - a situation which could only end in the death of one or both of them.
In this scenario, Laius would in his (earlier) turn have also undergone a similar sacred marriage with (a representative of) the same (mother) goddess.  Again, one could see how this could have been later misinterpreted, such that he came to be considered the previous husband of the 'mother' (goddess) of Oedipus, ie Oedipus' father.
Just a thought.

2595,1403930711,"The faithful dogs portrayed in this homecoming section of the story are symbolic. The swineherd's dogs, trained by Eumaeus to guard the hogs, charge Odysseus in the guise of an old beggar when he approaches the enclosure (B14, L33). The behaviour of Eumaeus on this occasion distinguishes him from those who gave Odysseus and his men a barbarous reception during their travels in strange lands. Also, his hurry to drive the dogs off and protect the 'old man' is different from the uncivilised behaviour one might expect of the suitors of Penelope were they to witness guard dogs rushing a stranger approaching Odysseus' courtyard. The swineherd's dogs recognise Telemachus, nuzzling him without a growl, as he returns from abroad (B16, L5-6); indoors, Odysseus is quick to perceive the meaning of the 'quiet welcome' (L6-12). Athena approaches the lodge, unseen by Telemachus but visible to Odysseus and the dogs (which respond by running off with a whimper) (B16, L84). Not every dog is man's best friend, though, as Book 14 ends with Eumaeus heading outside to sleep amidst the boars and taking with him a 'lance to fight off men and dogs' (L599). Another negative reference to dogs occurs when Eumaeus is called a dog by the goatherd Melanthius after he kicks at Odysseus in beggar form. Both the king and the swineherd refrain from responding with force, but Eumaeus can't keep himself from cursing Melanthius, who replies, 'All bark and no bite from the vicious mutt' (B17, 254-272). Finally, Argos sees through Odysseus' disguise, and the master's comment on the dog gives the swineherd a chance to praise the loyal animal and criticise the disloyal humans who have neglected both the dog and their duties to their absent master (B17, L317-360). The dogs guarding the swine and the dog guarding the palace know their place, are loyal to their masters and exhibit the kind of loyalty Odysseus must find in key servants and his son and wife if his homecoming is to be a success.",2

So we have Ã‚Â our binary pairsold - newearth - heavencountry - cityroyalty -democracyfemale - maleunfair- justiceAnd I thought Hesiod was hard on us, Apollo is not only the god of poetry but of misoginy:.APOLLO IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you something else, to show how rightI am: the so-called mother of the childisnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s begetter, but only a sort770of nursing soil for the new-sown seed.The man, the one on top, is the true parent,while she, a stranger, fosters a strangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sprout,if no god blights it. And I can prove it to you:a father can give birth without a mother.The last sentence Ã‚Â no Ã‚Â doubt will have made laugh the audience but clever Aeschylus gives the final coup and wins the eternal thanks of the goddess when he continues:Ã‚Â And here before us is our witness, childof Olympian Zeus, daughter who never fedand grew within the darkness of a womb,a seedling that no goddess could bring forth.In all things, Pallas, and with all my power,Now I know why Athens was the chosen city. I have to admit it is a clever trick and maybe apart Ã‚Â from structuralism we have some functionalism at work, because how many goddesses can claim to be revered in such a powerful city and not having a mother? Not many.So all these pairs, these contrapositions between the Furies Ã‚Â and Apollo worked hand in hand into the way to Athens and Democracy. And it makes sense because this new system that has citizens instead of subjects, where men use discourse as an essential part of civic life, where women are not citizens really cannot have these old chthonic goddesses going around being more important Ã‚Â than Apollo who fought the snake or Athena the goddess who did not need a womb to be born.It is pure craftmanship, the perfect combination between structuralism and binary parts and functionalism and I personally admire more Aeschylus than ever. Ã‚Â Not Ã‚Â to mention the elegance in his expressions even when I did not read the original in Greek the scene of the trial is marvellous, like a ""You can't handle the truth!"" but in Athens. And Apollo saying:Ã‚Â APOLLO Our quiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s empty, all our arrows shot.Ã‚Â Just perfect.I mentioned Graves before, though he was not an official scholar because when he talks about Clytemnestra he mentions the matriarcal regime of Mycenae where she was the rightful heiress. I would love to see the whole thing under that ligh but matriarcal regime Ã‚Â in terms of politics has always been a little weak for me. What I feel here , following Aeschylus' plays is that in this new system the blood connection was not really important or essential to get power. The legitime heir born from the king and the queen was not loger necessary. Now they vote, they had theÃ‚Â Ã¡Â¼ÂÃŽÂºÃŽÂºÃŽÂ»ÃŽÂ·ÃÆ’ÃŽÂ¯ÃŽÂ± to rule, strategoi to command the armies. The legitime heir was not a real necessity so probably the vessel was not really what mattered anymore. My hope is that those vessels were at Ã‚Â least the affliction to Ã‚Â the citizens of Athens for a while.( I am using the Burian &amp; Shapiro translation, Oxford Univeristy Press. 2011)",2

59,1402283838,"I've always looked at Ancient Greeks religion and the rituals performed to their gods and their beliefs in their stories as their religion values. If you look at the myths and what each god represents, you see that ancient Greeks believed in things like afterlife, living righteously which could lead to the better level of afterlife (isle of the blessed) in hades, in pray, in sacrifice, all of these are basis of a lot of religions now and then. I think their one of the starters of religion practices, along with the Sumerians, their gods and their stories are what lead to our own religious values and practices.

2560,1403901514,"No I meant in the days of the myth itself as in when everyone in the community believed in the same gods and there weren't any conflicting beliefs to be taken into account, where there was a clear sense of how things should be, but I'm intrigued as to how you mean! I was sort of comparing it to how we saw things from say the late 60s after Levi Strauss, when we knew there were other ways of making sense of the world than our own so a certain relativity and dislike of rigid boundaries came in. Its hard for us to see things in structuralist terms because we're post structuralist but we can use the theory to appreciate how the ancients saw things in a clear cut way. That's sort of what I was getting at but as I say I don't really know that much about it. Hopefully the OP or someone in the know will come back and enlighten us a bit more! I find the theories the most interesting part but I think they're also maybe the hardest especially Structuralism. I'd love to know more about it and why its a major theory for myth",3
