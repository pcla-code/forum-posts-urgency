ModPo has introduced me to the idea of poetry as vocal, not necessarily written, and now I'm itching to go and practice my own vocal experiments.However.I think it's really important here, in this thread, to acknowledge [REDACTED] opening remark and to allow that what one person finds ""superb"" may be another person's ""fingernails on a blackboard"". Previously, during ModPo, I have voiced a negative feeling I had towards a certain poet's work or voice, and I was immediately surrounded by anxious TAs clamouring to persuade me otherwise. I think this is actually disrespectfulÂ to the student and, in any case, truly counter-productive. As an example- a month ago I hated Gertrude Stein's repetitions with a passion. She made my neck itch. She made me want to scratch my ears off. And I'm not exaggerating. Looking back, I think that the reaction I had was good, it was in fact appropriate, it was a symptom of the fact that I was engaging fully and absolutely with the text and the poet's voice. If I had been indifferent to Stein, then it would have been a concern, but to be passionately negative is still a passionate reaction and should be accepted as such. I now list Stein is one of my favourite poets, but even if I did not, it would still be good... even great.In this particular case (Morris's work) there is an additional sensitivity, perhaps,Â because the poem speaks of / enactsÂ the deeply horrifying experiences of African Americans. But I do not think [REDACTED] was referring to that at all, I think ([REDACTED], forgive me if I'm putting words in your mouth) he was describing a spontaneous reaction to a work of art, and that's beautiful in and of itself.",2.0

Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay.Â We have included an optional set of questions that you may use when reading your peers' essays. Use these questions

        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


This essay summarizes the poem rather than analyzing it.  The first stanza does what it does: so what?  Why is that important?  What does it lead you to say about the movement of the poem, the action of the poem? Similarly, the poem has so many stanza doing so many things: so what?  Is the form of the poem important to the ideas it expresses?  Your essay only goes to the surface of the poem -- it tells what happens in it, but not what it does or how it does it.

Dickinsonâ€™s poem â€œI taste a liquor never brewedâ€ is a
celebration of, even a reveling in, a state of ever increasing exhilaration that
leads to a peak experience.&nbsp; The
extended metaphor is that of inebriation.&nbsp;
The reader must figure out for himself the source of the inebriation,
which is at first presented as a puzzle: how can there be a liquor that is
never brewed? 

&nbsp;The intoxicant is described as air and dew.&nbsp; Man can not create either air or dew
but they are always present.&nbsp; We
are led to think of the natural world as the stimulant, with some support from
additional nature imagery later in the poem: bee, foxglove, butterfly,
sun.&nbsp; Air and dew (water) are the
stuff of life. The mere acts of breathing and drinking, of just living, is a state of wonder that is being compared to a chemical high.

&nbsp;

Dickinsonâ€™s poem would lack interest had it merely listed
some nature imagery.&nbsp; But there is a
progression of steadily building intensity in the poem. Each stanza, clearly
marked by line division and a traditional (as in ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" &nbsp;ABCB rhyme pattern, brings the reader one more
step along the path of the poet.&nbsp;
The first stanza begins with just a taste, by the second the poet has
reached inebriation and debauch. By the third stanza she has gone beyond the
lower pleasures of animals into a distinctly human and possibly dangerous
realm. The stanzas also progress through the year. The second
stanza is summer, and the third is the time that butterflies leave, the autumn.
With this in mind, we can look back to stanza 1 and see the spring showers in
the pearly clouds.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We may think we are prepared for the final stanza, which logically should represent winter and death.&nbsp; The
poem does connect with winter, via the snowy hats, but there is a surprise in
store. The poet does not die; the poet moves beyond death. She sees the&nbsp; saints and seraphs and even passes them
by.&nbsp; She is no drunkard who leans
on a lamppost on the way down. She reaches the source of all life, the Sun, and actually touches it.&nbsp; The use of the final dash is
brilliant.&nbsp; It sets the Sun apart
from the rest of the poem as a self-sufficient entity that exists on its own without verb. We might even take a
Christian reading of the poem and see it as a portrayal of the trajectory of
life leading to the Son of God. The fever pitch is communicated to the reader, who shares the poet's culminating peak experience.

1. The student does quote Dickinson and explains thoroughly the quotes he/she choose. He/she effectively coveys the how of the poem by explaining different possibilities to what the poem is about, he/she gives their stand on what Dickinson could possibly mean when she wrote this essay. The essay does this by making references to words that are in the poem, for example ""(We can assume by the reference to the Rhine, a river that runs through much of Europe, including France, that she means to include wine, although wine is fermented, not brewed.)"" The essay gives a convincing explanation and makes you understand what the author was really trying to convey through her poem.
2. He/she does address the punctuation of the poem although there is just one sentence pertaining to the punctuation, it is sufficient enough for us to understand why the poem is punctuated like that.
3. Yes the author of essay does address the structure of the poem, in each paragraph he/she addresses a specific stanza. The essay speaks of the author's drunkenness and the possible explanations of why she might be drunk on the poetry.
4. The essay doesn't address why the author decides not to stick to the metaphor of the tavern, the essay does address the way the language of the poem changes throughout the poem and how by the progress of the poem the author seems to get more sophisticated, she first started with beer and she continues to fine wine. The essay addresses all the points correctly and analyzes most of the poem, and provides with explanations.

The writer does a good job of explaining the essence of the poem, and covers the major thought points in sequence from stanza to stanza. The interpretation of imagery of ""Molten Blue"" and the ""Tavern"" to that of laying in the summer grass lost in the beauty of the moment is a good one, as is the writer's suggestion that Dickinson is experiencing a complete awareness of surrounding, and as natural extension to that of the inner-self.  The writer also makes an interesting comment on the angels and saints approval of her head-over-heels ""intoxication"" of nature, and as an extension of that, that this may be the only such inebriation to meet with their acceptance.
The essay would have been more well-rounded if the writer had commented on either form and function, punctuation, or progression, but overall it is an effective and well written analysis.

I really enjoyed reading this well-structured and carefully written essay. After a week of viewing so many submissions, I have a better sense of what we were all instructed to do, and I feel you followed the guidelines quite skillfully. 
I especially admire the way you examined the poem, and then presented the notion that Dickinson is making an argument for the poet's view, the poet's life of examining nature closely. Your claim, ""all poets can (likely) agree on the fact that they see life differently: with more heightened emotion, in more vibrant color, perhaps even grittier than it truly is"" might read as an imposition of your own thoughts on Dickison's poem, but it works because you back it up with your next sentence:
 ""In ""I taste a liquor never brewed, "" Dickinson conveys this same kind of heightened experience.""
Great work on going through the poem methodically â€”Â and then you did a lovely job of wrapping it all up, tying the end back to your original claim. Thoroughly enjoyable and worth reading.

Thank you for introducing me to this Maya Angelou poem ""Still I Rise.""  It is an indictment, a challenge, and an homage to the invincible spirit of an oppressed people.   The Bernadette Mayer experiment that you conducted eliminated the word ""you may"" and ""you."" with interesting results.    ""You may"" is a form of speech that politely challenges the truth of a statement.   By removing the ""you may"" the lines become more declarative and imperative.   The inclusion of ""you may"" emphasizes the fact that whatever you think it doesn't make it true.   However, the elimination of the word ""you"" did not lead to a greater emphasis or understanding of the poem.   But I did go one step further and delete the possessive plural of ""you"" which is ""Your"" as well as all personal pronouns - including ""I"", ""me""   and ""my"".   Strangely, the elimination of all personal pronouns provides a sense of a larger community of both the living and the dead.    Whatever you do to this poem cannot change the impact of the word ""rise""  as a gospel hymn.

This was such a well written essay! Not only did you touch on the meanings of why Dickinson uses certain dashes and grammar, but you were clear on the meaning of the metaphors and the poem in general. Your poem was very easy to understand and I would say you followed the directions very well! 

When I first pictured Emily Dickinson I thought of a girl who sits in her room 24/7, never comes out, and is always just writing poems. After reading this poem I kind of got a different feeling. Did you? 

Any ways, this was a great essay. Great job!

First, both versions of this poem might be categorized as imagist. Â Each is in free verse, uses vernacular language and concentrates on conveying a hard image - that of a mother who is crying while holding her baby in her lap. Â In both cases Williams seems to select his subject the way a photographer might, converting a moment's observation into a fixed image for the reader (viewer.) Â Of course there is a major difference between the two versions: version one tells a story and version two does not. Â Version one pivots on an explicit irony: the source of a mother's weary tears is the baby in her lap, who has robbed her - of her youth? her energy? her life? - and who is obliviously rubbing his nose while his mother cries. Â The picture is clear, but clearly contains narrative elements selected to convey a specific story of mother's (hopefully) momentary despair. Â Version two is stripped down, the irony gone, the story almost completely effaced. Â What the reader gets is a picture, an image, that is so static and hard-edged that it only barely suggests the mother's sadness and the baby's responsibility for that sadness. Â  The result is the poetic equivalent of erecting a statue. Â In place of the homely details of version one, we get a picture so stark and severe that it suggests not the specific details of something Dr. Williams observed but a sort of timeless image of maternal resignation. Â Â Both of these versions of the poem are beautiful. Â But which is the most ""Imagist?"" Â Well, the fourth element of the Imagist manifesto is, ""To Present an Image.""

sure â€œsuccess,â€ â€œeffectiveness,â€ and â€œfaithfulnessâ€ arenâ€™t necessarily intended
as three separate approaches from which to consider Williamsâ€™s â€œYoung Woman at
a Window,â€ Iâ€™d like to focus mostly on the poemâ€™s faithfulness to the tenets of
Imagism, and in doing so address to some degree what it would mean to be
faithful to any movement.Â  To be literal,
â€œfaithfulnessâ€ â€“ the state of having faith, belief, or hope in the validity or
efficacy of an ethic or approach to some aspect of life â€“ would, in respect to poetic
method, suggest that commitment to the approach lead to the creation of a poem
whose words, lines, stanzas, and expression would in turn (however applied in
the poemâ€™s form) engender apprehension of an idea or of a feeling,
comprehension of meaning, and the embodiment of an authorâ€™s vision and
experience of the world.Â  In the case of
Imagism, faith is specifically invested in concrete, specific, and sometimes
spare embodiments of the perceived world; and perhaps because of faith in the
power of these embodiments, the meaning of the perceived world will be vested
in the poem â€“ and, upon the poemâ€™s reading, translated to another.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The second
version of â€œYoung Woman at a Windowâ€ amounts to a far greater expression of
faith in Imagism than the first.Â  While
this faith is displayed in many ways throughout the poem, it is most obvious in
the matter of concentration on a single image, a criteria expressed overtly in
the sixth element of the â€œImagist manifesto.â€Â 
While the same two figures, the woman and child, inhabit both versions
of the poem, in the second version it is as if the two figures become one.Â  The separate identities of the woman and
child collapse into a single, representative image.Â  Individual motive disappears.Â  Time becomes an instant.Â  Williams creates this effect with the opening
line.Â  From the first versionâ€™s â€œWhile
she sits,â€ the second version reduces the line, eliminating chronological or
causative relation between the figures, and instead directly states â€œShe sits
with.â€Â  No longer are the two delineated
by time or by the actions of one distinguishable in time from those of the
other.Â  Through inclusion of the
preposition â€œwith,â€ their relationship becomes spatial, yet they are shown to
exist in the same space.Â  Therefore their
separate actions or means of expression â€“ â€œtears on/ her cheekâ€ . . . â€œnose
pressed/ to the glassâ€ are not independent, as we are given to think of the
actions of unique individuals, but extensions of one another.Â  

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This
cohesion effected in the second poem potentially suggests an interpretation
different from the first â€“ an occurrence caused by the narratorâ€™s diminished
role in the poem.Â  No longer are we told
that the child has robbed the woman or that he â€œknows nothing of/ his
theft.â€Â  As plain as such lines might be,
the faithful Imagist might view them as intrusions of the kind a â€œcosmic poetâ€
would make.Â  If one equates the cosmic
poet mentioned in the manifesto with a Whitman or those given to embellishment,
such insertions ought to be expunged.Â  In
Williamsâ€™s poetry, however, such lines could hardly be likened to those of a
â€œcosmic poet,â€ though they are the lines of one who knows the scene he looks
upon and then guides the reader with his words.Â 
Not only does he wish us to see as he sees, in version one, but heâ€™d
have us know as he knows.Â  Perhaps for
Williams the Imagist this is too much, for speaking as he does shows little
faith in his cause.Â  Simplicity alone
must carry truth, and the world as it is seen convey itself.Â  With authorial self-effacement,
interpretation â€“ and with it the world â€“ comes more into the realm of the
reader.

Â 

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because a
faith in Imagism has governed the development of Williamsâ€™s second version of
â€œYoung Woman at the Window,â€ it becomes a successful and effective foray into
Imagist technique.Â  I ask myself whether
in doing so it has also become a separate poem.Â 
Change a word or line and no poem can be the same.Â  Yet has the poem lost the conflict between
woman and child implicit in version 1?Â 
Situational tension seems to have increased with the greater concision
of version 2.Â  With that, perhaps the
tension or cause of tension becomes more shared and symbiotic.Â  â€œ[H]er hand/ the childâ€ marks the midpoint of
the poem, yet does so unobtrusively, and without a prepositional relationship until
the next line.Â  Could child somehow be
womanâ€™s hand?Â  And then whose nose is
pressed to the glass?Â  To the faithful
Imagist does the world faithfully rendered defy interpretation?

This poem
written by Oâ€™Hara consists in a parable or an allegory about poetry and
painting. In this poem the author clearly expounds the differences between these
two arts; he points out the great importance of words in the art of poetry and
compares it to the equally great importance of ideas and visual elements in
painting.

The main
difference between these two arts is well described in the lines: Â ""There
should be/ so much more, not of orange, of/ words, of how terrible orange is/
and life."" Â Through these lines
the author is telling us that poetry can stimulates our thoughts thanks and
trough words, as painting is an art which is devoted to our sight.

When the
painter began to work on his painting, the author could see the letters of the
words SARDINES on the canvas but in the end the only reference to â€œsardinesâ€ can
be found in the title of the painting. Oâ€™Hara wants us to understand that
paintings are made of paint and visual element, not words what remains in the
end is a canvas picturing the painterâ€™s idea of sardines, his own
representation of it. At the opposite, poetry is made of words and not of visual
representations like colors; this is why the orange Oâ€™Hara has written about is
only present in the title of his work. 

In this poem
Oâ€™Hara explains the differences between poetry and painting but he definitely praises
both of these arts. This poem tells us that O Hara is not a painter because his
heart and soul are filled with words, and that he canâ€™t help using them.
Whatever he thinks about he always has thousand of words to describe and
explain his ideas to the world and this is why he is a poet and not a painter.

In
his poem Why I Am Not a Painter, Frank Oâ€™Hara is going back and forth between
the painter Mike Goldbergâ€™s work Sardines, and Oâ€™Haraâ€™s own set of poems,
Oranges. The poemâ€™s tense is present, except when describing the process of the
painting, where it turns to present continuous. It is also present continuous
at the pre-process of writing, with the word thinking. 



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Although the poem is in present
tense, it is not a narrative poem. A non-narrative. Thereâ€™s no cause and effect
relationship between the events, and sometimes no connection between the
sentences.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The painter Mike Goldberg comes
across as confident and knowledgeable about his art. He invites the poet to
drink while working, such a pleasurable activity! When the poet asks a
question, the painter always has a clear cut answer. The poet could enviously experience
the process of the painting. 



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Oâ€™Hara depicts the process of
writing differently. Thereâ€™s the thinking.
The actual poem writing is not described, as if it is magical and done without
the poetâ€™s control. He wants to write about orange, how orange is awful like
life, he fills pages with trying to depict his thinking, but he canâ€™t do it
accurately. There is the inadequacy of words to be true to the conveyance of
reality. He is circling his subject, orange, with the object of his words,
referencing his ideas the way Gertrude Stein referenced her objects in Tender
Buttons, indirectly. Thereâ€™s frustration.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The process of writing is depicted
as a difficult, magical process. Compared to the painter, the poet is helpless
in his writing. In the deep experience of writing, he is thrilled to discover
himself a real poet, looking wonderingly at what is coming out of his alchemic
efforts: prose.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thereâ€™s a sense of fun and wonder in
the poem. Fun with the abstract ideas of words, orange or sardines, fun
with (named) friends and drinking, conversation, fun with experimentation in
language as an artifice of the urban world. The poem mixes traditional mediums
of the separate arts. Words used for painting, and colors for poetry. This mix
in art mediums points further to the level of experimentation and fun. Oâ€™Hara
is using a conversational style, in his famous â€œI do this I do thatâ€ form. The
line breaks are apt form for bringing further surprises in every new line. The
line breaks add to the â€œand thenâ€ style of the poemâ€™s unfolding.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Yet, with the sense of fun, thereâ€™s
also the dark side, that always peeks into Oâ€™Haraâ€™s poems. In this poem the
dark side is the meaning of the written poems in Oranges. The meaning that is
so needed, and is so hard to portray.



Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the end, it is the dark side that
makes him a poet. We come to see that both the painter and the poet use words.
The painter uses the word sardines as
a visual for his canvas. The poet uses the word orange to convey an abstract idea of color. For both, words are
representational, an object and a symbol. Thereâ€™s no direct answer to the
question, why I am not a painter. Thereâ€™s the fun, the pain, the mystery of
writing and the resulting pride.

Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay.Â We have included an optional set of questions that you may use when reading your peers' essays. Use these questions

        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


Your last paragraph is a good description of the 'irony' of the situation. You deal with the form of the poem and what it means for the poet. I liked you notice of how he uses the word ""Well"" to change tacks about how he veiws his talent as opposed to his friend's talent. Well Done!

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.  This is where the text of your essay goes.
With
â€œA liquor never brewedâ€, Emily Dickinson is referring to the Nature, and
throughout this poem, she is using different lively metaphors to show how much
the nature enthralls and captivates her. She is enjoying and drinking in the
beauty of the nature the way one tastes wine till drunk and inebriate. In the
second sentence, the author drinks a liquor â€œfrom tankards scooped in pearlâ€,
suggesting that pearl, the essence of the nature, is exactly the kind of â€œwine
never brewedâ€ she is tasting. The description also implies that the tankards, i.e.
drinking cups, overflow and brim with pearl, which is also a beautiful creation
that takes time to develop in a shell deep in the ocean before it becomes refined
and perfect, just like a wine which takes time to brew or years to store before
it becomes richly tasty. This is the first metaphor in the poem, inspiring the readers
to feel the power and depth of the nature through a new sense (of taste) and perspective.
The author also associates the nature with the magic and powerful&nbsp;effects of wine, a sensual
experience commonly shared. 

In
the second paragraph, the author is inebriate and drunk of air while indulging
herself in dew like an addiction. Air is the natureâ€™s vital component which
gives life to all creations on earth. It also reminds people of a healthy,
refreshing state when one breathes in ample fresh air. Dew, on the other hand,
signifies the start of a morning, the hope of another new day. It is the precious
drops sparkling on leaves, condensation and gem of the nature. According to
dictionary, debauchee is a person addicted to excessive indulgence in sensual
pleasure. It has negative connotation like the word â€œinebriateâ€ which implies
someone is intoxicated, static and unconscious. With the ironic contrast between
inebriate vs. air and debauchee vs. dew (positive vs. negative),&nbsp;the author obviously presents a very
new&nbsp;and different&nbsp;way of thinking and appreciation for nature which broadens our imagination and
extends our sensory limits. 

With
â€œReeling, through endless summer daysâ€, there is something valuable coming from
 the incessant cycle of summer, the most vibrant season of the nature. It also
resonates with â€œthe Sunâ€ mentioned in the last sentence of the poem, which symbolizes
eternity, unlimited energy and core of the universe. While inns are usually
where travelers stay and enjoy refreshment like food and beverage, the wine of
the nature comes from â€œinns of molten blueâ€. Molten means liquefied, whereas
blue probably stands for water. It could be a running river or the ocean, full
of life.

In
the third paragraph, the author â€œshall but drink the moreâ€ when bees and
butterflies, both summer insects, are so drunk too till they are expelled or
give up their last cup. The author personifies the insects and considers them as
her drinking fellows, celebrating life together wildly and enjoying life to the
full.

In the last paragraph, angels (seraphs) and saints make
their appearance in the poem. They embody sacredness of the nature which is Godâ€™s
creation. Seraphs swing their snowy hats, a metaphor of clouds moving in heavens.
Saints on earth, who desires to see God, rush to the window, which symbolizes the
letting in of light and enlightenment. And the little tippler they see is
either metaphoric to the spirit of the nature or the Creator who enjoys His
creation -- the nature and the earth, so much like one tastes a wine. But it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;most&nbsp;divine, profound&nbsp;alcohol, a liquor never brewed!&nbsp;(i.e. non-alcohol,&nbsp;sinless and&nbsp;sacred) &nbsp;&nbsp;

You had a very neat, original poem. I prefer the 2nd version with the pronouns omitted, as I am personally a fan of condensory. I also believe that it leaves the poem more open than the original, and therefore a bit more interesting (although I still very much liked the first). However, I noticed that you left out ""is"" in the last line of the first stanza. This should have been kept since it is a verb, not a pronoun. The third version, though not my favorite, was very interesting to read and to note the differences between it and the original. Your explanations were very well created, and they gave a good summary of each poem. Great job!

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Reviewing of this essay turns out to be a very difficult task. 
The essay  should have been about what makes the second version of ""Young Woman at a Window"" more imagist than the first version of the poem. It should have explained how the versions conform to the principles and ideas of imagism as they are declared in the manifesto.
But it is a different essay.  It speaks about ""the shut window"".  The interpretation is  extensive, interesting and thought provoking. It would have been a perfect example of an essay if the task were to simply do a close reading of the versions.

    2. What does this essay have to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?
    For writing experiments and essays written by students choosing Option B:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing? Does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtaposition(s) between
        the original and the ""written-through"" experiment?
    2. Does the writer have something to say about this kind of ""writing through"" a previous text, or about aleatory or ""unoriginal"" poetry generally? Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?

I love how you experimented with the both mesostic and a Mayer process.  You justified all your rules for your Mayer experiment and it worked out great. I see what you mean about other subjects showing up after eliminating the blackbirds.  Wonderfully done.  I really enjoyed your experiment and interpretation!

I think you did a really good job of actually quoting the poem and then explaining what you thought of it and also giving a few definitions here and there. I also loved how you explained the inns of molten blue and how you pictured this in your own mind. However, I got a little lost at the part when you spoke about men drinking at a bar and how Dickinson wouldn't get kicked out. It's not that you are wrong, it's just that all of the other paragraphs have a little more excitement to read and that one wasn't as enlightening to read. Overall, this essay was enjoyable to read.

Great essay, you give a full explanation of the poem, I think your work is very interesting. I like the way you describes O'Hara's language and his work. I agree with you this poem is a celebration of two different form of art, poetry and painting, but we can also see that poetry is O'Hara 's favorite art because he is a man of Words.

Your essay has helped me appreciate the force of opposites in this poem, both how they create tension and meaning. This essay flows nicely, moving from stanza to stanza in a way that was pleasant to read. I thought your observation that ""The 'butterflies' and 'bees' move from one 'summer' flower to the next, as a poet ...from one idea... to another, and ...anticipate the ...shift....that comes with the fourth stanza,"" was especially good. This made me wonder if, in a longer essay, you might have something interesting to say about the use of opposition versus shift in this poem. Your discussion of Dickinson's use of dashes and form would be more interesting if tied to your main argument regarding her use of contrast. Going through this essay and eliminating some unnecessary phrasing would highlight your ideas, and I suspect, would lead you deeper into your insights.

I liked this point that the essayist made best of all, ""a poet must condense and erase, just like the painter has had to do."" I also appreciated your comparisons of O'Hara's process with that of Godlberg's and the fact that O'Hara (the poet) begins with visual, picuturesque inspiration whereby Goldberg (the painter) begins with a written word to inspire the blank canvas. I, too, mentioned the similarities among the two men in their creative process. Nicely done and clearly written.

I really appreciate the way you have analysed the poetry and tried to explain the meanings and metaphors that are used by the poet.
I like the God and Nature interpretation. However, one thing that I feel you should know is Dickinson was not much of a believer, rather she was a rebel who did not believe in God.
Never mind, for I feel poetry interpretation should be both from the view of the poet as well as from that of the reader. Good job!

Then she keeps going on her life, or she just leaves the church and goes home, listening to other people's incomplete conversations on the way, to other Is who carry other truths and beliefs with them, other than religious ones.

The beginning of this reading, not yet an essay, contains some acute observations: I agree that the poem is"" about experiencing ecstasy through nature, ""the bouncer at the bar"" is a lovely phrase and could be applicable to the ""landlord"" cutting off the drunken bees, but this writer sees the poem's movement as seasonal, through time, and doesn't provide convincing evidence for that reading, unless it is inspired by ""the snowy hats"" of the seraphs in the last stanza, though there is little else to support it except the ""endless summer days,"" which are not connected to images of spring or fall.  And the writing treats the different elements of the poem separately without pulling them together into an integrated whole.

Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Great interpretation!

The
title â€œWhy I Am Not a Painterâ€ is supposed to engage the reader in a
comparative assessment
between pictorial and poetic production. Like Lessing whose â€œLaocoÃ¶n and the
limits of painting and poetryâ€ seems to elevate poetic production above
painting, Oâ€™Hara too seems to suggest the superiority of literary over visual
representation as a means of artistic expression. In the two stanzas that
follow, however, his arguments do not unfold rationally, despite the poemâ€™s
deceptive simplicity and straightforward language. Rather
Oâ€™Hara makes use of an anamorphic perspective, that is he creates a distorted
projection which requires the reader to â€œoccupy a specific vantage pointâ€
(wiki) to reconstitute the verbal image. I use the term â€œanamorphosisâ€ (from
the Greek words meaning formed again)
in order to describe the transformation of the two dimensional pictorial image
of the â€œSardinesâ€ into a multi- dimensional poetic image of the â€œOranges.â€ After
posing the question Why (not a painter)? the poet proceeds in the first stanza
to expose the limits and limitations of pictorial representation. Mike Goldberg,
who is his New York school painter-friend, seems very much at ease with his
vocation. He seems to respond intuitively to the demands of his painting. He
claims for example, that the Sardines belong to the painting because ""it
needed something there."" At a later version of the painting, however, the
Sardines are substituted with painted letters (possibly the letters that make
up the word â€œSardinesâ€). To the
poetâ€™s question on the elimination of the Sardines, the painter replies â€œit was
too much,â€ implying that an objective depiction of the Sardines in the painting
is redundant or perhaps it would damage the various imaginative interpretations
of the painting by limiting its explication to one and specific realistic
reference to a school of Sardines. Considering however that Sardines are a type
of fish that migrates along the coast in large schools or that in popular
culture, Sardines can invoke a situation where people or objects are crowded
together, for instance, in a bus or subway car, the finished painting without
the Sardines albeit having retained the name â€œSardinesâ€ in its title, could to
be taken to be a subtle critique of mass urban culture. Thus, the painting
involves a degree of abstraction but is nevertheless confined to its
two-dimensional nature.

In
the second stanza the poet juxtaposes the process of literary creation to that
of a painting. The germ of his work is the color â€œorange.â€ Apparently, he
cannot convey the meaning and associative significance of this color by depicting
orange objects onto the canvas; this is something that his painter-friend might
have done and even he did not seem to consider this type of realistic representation
adequate. This is why both the painter and the poet resort to words.Â  But if the invocation of a word and its
meaning through its letters fulfills the purpose of the painting, for the poet
a few words or a line are not enough to convey the multitude of sensations and
meanings and affective significance the term â€œorangeâ€ evokes. Or, as the poet
characteristically says â€œThere should be so much moreâ€¦of words, of how terrible
orange is and life.â€ I take this to mean that the poet exercises free
association, he writes down pages and pages of unconstrained association of
ideas without submitting his work to emotional censorship or imposing formal
limitations to it. The
freer and more uninhibited his prose is, the more real a poet he becomes, he
claims. Thus, the text he envisioned to write on the color â€œorangeâ€ has already
undergone a transformation: the poetic line has become pages and pages of
prose. But, just like the painter had to give up representational art to attain
a multiplicity of meanings, in turn the true poet has to sacrifice the illusion
that linguistic transparency and meaning are conveyed when breaking free from
formal constraints. So his text undergoes yet a second transformation: from
poetic prose it has become a collection of twelve poems under the title ORANGES,
an example of which is the poem we are reading. As artists, both Oâ€™Hara and
Goldberg face the same problems of artistic expression. Both make similar but
not identical artistic choices. Oâ€™Haraâ€™s ORANGES stand in anamorphic relation
to Goldbergâ€™s SARDINES, while in both the object of representation has been
removed from the artwork.Â Â Â

This essay was such a pleasure to read. From your initial observation that the Baroness ""of course"" wanted three-and-a-half mesostics to your final conclusion that this might be as close as you'll ever get to being inside her mind, you write in a style that is fresh and light and breezy and entertaining. At the same time, you present a close analysis and interesting ideas about the punctuation, the meanings of many of the words and phrases in the mesostics, and on the philosophical issue of who ""wrote"" these mesostics. Very well done. And I am now thinking seriously of hanging a ""chemicals in all trouble--they're you"" sign in my study.

    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.

The essay does a nice job of breaking down each stanza and tying the together. The writer of the essay references biblical literature and actually makes a direct connection between passages in the bible and stanzas in the poem. These comparisons are very effective and demonstrate the essay writer's knowledge of the bible and biblical references. While I am not sure that the biblical undertones is the intent of the author it is certainly an intriguing  and well constructed analysis. I particularly like the work done with the idea of spirit, renewal and transcendence, ideas that I believe would have been consistent with the writings of Emily Dickinson.

We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Wonderful written English!    1. You successfully discuss that  V2 is condensed in ways that fit the Imagist Manifesto.  2.  No discussion of grammar, which may be hard to do in a foreign language.  3. You noted the preposition ""there"" so I know you are on to this, but have not fully developed it.  You noted the ambiguous language pertaining to the ""theft"" and ""robbery"" by the child.  Your essay is similar to mine and I feel it is well done for a beginner level of poetry in general and Imagism in particular.  The grading suggestions #4 and #5 are quite advanced expectations that I'm sure most of us have not achieved.  Thank you for taking the time to do this assignment thoroughly.  Enjoy the rest of class!

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
Form:

&nbsp;

The form of the poem is that of four stanzas, each
comprising four lines of alternating iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.&nbsp; The only deviation from this form is in the
line â€˜Reeling â€“ throâ€¦â€™ where the first word has a natural trochaic beat.&nbsp; The rhythm of the poem has a driving quality
enhanced by the regular iambic meter; the use of dashes gives it a breathless,
emotionally intense tone which is enhanced by the exclamation marks terminating
the first and third stanza.

&nbsp;

Metaphor:

The dominant conceit of the poem is that of nature as an
intoxicating liquor, partaken of by both the creatures of the world (the
butterflies and bees) and the speaker.&nbsp;
The speaker lays claim to primacy in this regard, since (by the third
stanza at least) she will â€˜drink the moreâ€™ even when the butterflies and bees
are sated.&nbsp; In this she echoes the
bravado of drinkers at a certain stage of intoxication everywhere.

The inclusion of christian iconography(?) (seraphs, the highest angels in the
heavenly choir; saints, the most honored of religious humankind) links the speakerâ€™s
experience of nature with the highest forms of religious feeling: the
intoxication of the first three stanzas becomes a â€˜divine intoxicationâ€™ in the
final stanza, as the speaker is united (perhaps in death or unconsciousness)
with the sun-godhead in what could be described as Dionysian ecstasy.&nbsp; 

The state of her head the morning after such a â€˜sessionâ€™ is
not discussed.

In other contexts, the purported respect and interest shown
by the saints and seraphs towards the speaker might feel indicative of an
unhealthy egotism on her part. &nbsp;However,
the almost parental affection suggested by the description of her as a â€˜little
Tipplerâ€™ renders the effect charming and lightly touched with a pathos that
provides a counterbalance to the ecstatic conclusion of the final line of the
poem.

&nbsp;

The lines â€˜Inebriate of Air â€“ am I â€“ / And Debauchee of Dew â€“â€˜:

I would like to examine these two lines in detail.&nbsp; In the first line, the literal reading is
that the speaker is inebriated by air, which could be something as mundane as describing
the dizziness induced by hyperventilation.&nbsp;
However, the way in which the line is crafted offers much more.&nbsp; To be an â€˜inebriate of airâ€™ is suggestive of
being an â€˜initiateâ€™, which in turn is allusive of membership of secret
societies or religious orders.&nbsp; There is
a sense in which the speaker is claiming membership of both of these societies in
her relationship with nature; that she is privy to, and fully sensible of, the
natural world in a way which is unusual, rare and â€˜spiritualâ€™.&nbsp; In this way, the simple arrangement of the
first three words provides a sense in which the simple act of breathing has
been transfigured into a communion.&nbsp; The
final almost-pause of the dash before the concluding â€˜am Iâ€™ makes this claim
emphatic.

There is another aspect in which â€˜inebriateâ€™ contributes to
the meaning of the poem in a way â€˜inebriatedâ€™ would not.&nbsp; The latter connotes an act concluded, something
which has already happened, while â€˜inebriateâ€™ suggests an ongoing process, the speakerâ€™s
relationship with nature is open-ended and ongoing.&nbsp; There is an eternal, living-in-the-moment
quality to â€˜inebriateâ€™ which is entirely lacked by â€˜inebriatedâ€™.

The great satisfaction that the speaker feels in her
relationship with nature is suggested by the emphatic use of â€˜Andâ€™ to begin the
second line. &nbsp;It is as if she is saying: to
be an inebriate of air is a great gift, but to also be a debauchee of dew â€“ well,
who could ask for more?&nbsp; 

The use of â€˜debaucheeâ€™ mirrors the â€˜inebriateâ€™ of the first
line, though there is an escalation in the emotional register of these words.&nbsp; To be inebriated is one (possibly temporary) thing,
to be debauched connotes something more serious and permanent: to be corrupted,
dissolute, coarsened, etc.&nbsp; By linking
these words to air and dew, the speaker creates a contrast which overthrows
their usual negative connotations.&nbsp; The crude,
heavy, foggy associations the word â€˜inebriateâ€™ might carry are inverted by the spacious
clarity and light associated with â€˜airâ€™; in the same fashion the jewel-like, clean,
fresh associations of the word â€˜dewâ€™ act to subvert the usual meaning of â€˜debauchâ€™.&nbsp; Christian associations (with heaven, with manna)
may be drawn from â€˜airâ€™ and â€˜dewâ€™ respectively.&nbsp;


By subverting the normal meanings of inebriation and
debauchery, the speaker reinforces the sense that her relationship with nature
is special: in that context she has the freedom and power to overrule the norms
and conventions of human society and language.&nbsp;
The power that she feels is supported by the driving rhythm established
by the pairs of iambic tetrameter and trimeter that make up each stanza, the
almost breathless quality imparted by the use of hyphens, and the alliteration and assonance between â€˜inebriateâ€™
/ â€˜airâ€™ and â€˜debaucheeâ€™ / â€˜dewâ€™ in this particular pair of lines.

&nbsp;

On nature:

There is an appealing plainness to the nature described by
the speaker, a demotic accessibility.&nbsp;
There is no requirement for majestic redwoods or rare orchids to induce
the intoxication she describes: it is available in the plants and animals anyone
might find in any field.&nbsp; Shorn of adjectival
qualifiers, they are rendered in their most generic form: a butterfly, a
foxglove...&nbsp; If there is any specificity
in the vision of nature she evokes, it is the season and perhaps unusual warmth
implied by a sky of â€˜Molten Blueâ€™.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite
this, there is a sense that the warmth she feels is only partly climatic:
personal ardor, if not the purely physiological flush accompanying alcoholic
intoxication, is equally suggested.&nbsp; In
both senses of the word, the very atmosphere of the poem is heated.

Well, I wish I had *your* impressions of the experiments!  First, Virgin - I like it.  Whatever the original looked like, I really appreciate the clean language of this version. It is very spare and evocative.  My favourite line is ""our feet darkening the floor"".  What a perfect way to describe wet feet on raw, worn wood.  I'm certainly inspired to try this, myself, on some of my writing that i know to be too flowery to bother submitting anywhere.
As for Alea jacta est, that title certainly brought a smile to my face. My husband and I both had classical educations, so my children have heard that phrase more times than they can count.  I really enjoy found poetry, but in my own work with it, I always strive to make it accessible.  This truly has the feel of aleatory poetry.  It feels random, there is no obvious sense of communication from the writer, until the last line.  Do you like it, yourself?  Which is your favourite, of the two?

The Colonel



What you have heard is
true. I was in his house. His wife carried
a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails, his son went
out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the
cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over
the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English.
Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to
scoop the kneecaps from a manâ€™s legs or cut his hands to lace. On
the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had
dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for
calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of
bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief
commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was
some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot
said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed
himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say
nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries
home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like
dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one
of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water
glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As
for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them-
selves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last
of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some
of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the
ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.

    Peer review instructions: Use your peer review to comment on the ways in which your peers' essays approach this poem. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay.Â We have included an optional set of questions that you may use when reading your peers' essays. Use these questions
        as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. We have also recorded a video discussion of ""Why I Am Not a Painter."" If you can, watch this recording
        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


A letter to O 'Hara  - what a clever and delightful approach to the assignment! This is so readable, I'd like to quote lines from it. For example, I love your lines about colors equalling letters equalling lines and  about how painters choose ""concision"" and poets choose ""expansion"" , although I don't really believe it. Remember ""The Condensary""? Nevertheless, I really enjoyed reading your essay since it is so in the spirit of the New York school. Thanks !

I find a lot of your inferences rather curious and feel that this is prompting you to respond with a rather specious argument..  ""The poem is united by the spherical elements found in the words ""pearl', ""dew"" and finally ""sun"" representing the sea, earth, and sky.""--Don't really see that connection and find it a bit of a stretch of your imagination.
"" A flower (foxglove) naturally dies taking away the food source of the bee causing it to search out another flower. The bee has been evicted by the circle of life. ""--The flower is pollinated by the bee and the bee gathers the nectar and pollen of the flowers to make honey, beebread, beeswax, etc.--Don't see any reference to death here, just the drunken bee getting 86'd from the flower bar.
""And finally, she ascends to the heavens""--Think you are taking that way too literally--I don't think she is actually supposed to be leaning against the sun--I think she is lightheartedly(pun intended) comparing herself to the drunk who is held up by the lamppost(street light--light)--she is also being held up by a light, but of course hers is not man made.
All that being said, I do think you are getting the overall idea of the poem.  It is very much about the way nature inebriates one in opposition to even the best alcohol man can make.

TEXT OF ESSAY GOES HERE. Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form. This is where the text of your essay goes.
Each poem can be read as a single sentence.Â  The sentence in version 1 includes subordination, and sets up Â a relationship between child and woman, centering on the child's ambiguous ""theft"" from the woman, about which he knows nothing, and, inÂ  hinting at this relationship,Â WCW focuses attention on the subjectivities of woman and child. Â In Version 2, by effacing the relationship and interiority of version 1, Wiliams shortens the poem by one couplet (six words) and ""flattens,"" or sharpens the image, and also removes the temporal element which asks for story, and associated expectations of motivation and action.Â  In the first poem, by starting with the word ""while,"" WCW actually makes the child the subject of the sentence and focuses attention on his innocent theft, a motivated, if unconscious, action. Â  In the second version, time is removed, story and motivation are erased, the child is not the subject, just part of the scene, belongingÂ as inÂ a still-life to the holding vessel of the woman. Â There is no robbery mentioned, no innocent lack of knowing, and the child is not initiating the act of rubbing his nose.Â  Most of these changes are accomplished by excision of words, and a slight reordering.Â  WCW also addsÂ severalÂ Â elements, which enhance the visual aspects of the scene.Â  The child is now ""in her lap.""Â Â ""Little"" has been eliminated -- perhapsÂ a redundancy with ""child""-- and ""the child"" is rendered perhaps more distinctly (imagistically), more specifically, expressed by his sitting on the woman's lap.Â  So there is still a relationship between child and woman, but it is a spatial relationship, not a relationship hinted at by action and subjective state. ""This little child/who robs her""Â  becomes ""the child."" Â Even the displacement of ""the child"" to the second line of a couplet, rather than the first, deemphasizes the child's subjectivity.Â  He's just one more part of herÂ  (""her hand, the child,"") an unprivileged part of the still life, not identified, even, as ""her child."" The poem ends with the second major alteration.Â  The child is no longer rubbing his nose -- the theft is completely suppressed -- but ""his nose/pressed/to the glass"" represents a compressionÂ --Â  again a shift from an action which requires time and subjectivity to a momentary image, ""hard and clear.""Â  Of course the words, ""pressed/to the glass"" sound almost like a metapoetic reference to the imagist manifesto, asking for a poetry to describe what the world looks like if it were pressed to glass, as if the world were hard and clear.Â  ""Pressed,"" the only one word line of the poem, suggests and possibly enactsÂ both spatial and temporal compression.Â  Although poetry of this sort achieves a kind of ""definiteness,""Â  by its very suppression of action, motivation and relationships, its reliance on visual juxtaposition, its undefinedness, it engages the reader's subjectivity differently.Â  The poem itself is not a beautiful object, nor does it describe beauty, but it seems to lay claim on our own moral imagination, as we wonder: who, what, where and why.Â P.S. Â Although the imagists eschew traditional forms, Version 2 scans better to my ear. Â ""Glass"" sounds almost like a terminal rhyme. Â I think it picks ups the short ""a"" of hand, and is Â anticipated by the consonantal sibilance of ""pressed.""Â

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
You show how the first version does not fulfill the Imagist manifesto.  I like your metaphor of a garden pruner to describe WCW's second version of the poem. While you point out how this version uses condensation, you do not discuss how the poet achieves this through the use of grammar, punctuation, form. You also need to think about the poet's subjectivity in the second version.  Is the poet using narrative or suppressing narrative in the second version?

This essay was clearly written by someone who knows a lot about poetry, but I felt the writer did not make enough effort to share his or her thoughts with the reader.  The essay uses jargon, or perhaps scholarly short-hand, such as ""entheogenic experience of the I-lyrical"" instead of elaborating on the writer's ideas.  Overall, the essay has good ideas but states  them in a much too condensed manner.

A very perceptive essay closely following the apparent difference between the poet and the painter. The second  and the third stanzas have been effectively juxtaposed thereby treating the subject in a convincing manner. The mention of self-editing has been interesting In a way that generates a whole new approach to the process of creating their final pieces. The mention of time passing and the final evolution of the artists' impressions have been presented with much skill and the attention to detail.
Well done!

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
The whole poem â€œI Taste A Liquor Never Brewedâ€, holds
several references to alcohol and â€œinebriationâ€, such as â€˜liquorâ€™, â€˜Tankardsâ€™, â€˜drunkenâ€™
and so on. The poet talks of her love for nature, whose pleasure is above any
alcohol that man can make. The poet uses the ballad
form with a rhyming scheme abcb. 

In the first stanza, the poet introduces the reader to the
liquor that she has drunk giving her a great load of pleasure. She goes on to
illustrate the liquor by saying that it is â€œScooped in Pearlâ€. She compares it
to the alcohol of the â€œRhineâ€, Rhine
being a river in Germany, a country very well â€“ known for it Beer. The
exclamation at the end of the last line, further expresses the superiority of
the alcohol that she talks of. But, the interesting part of this stanza is the
first line! The poet says the alcohol that she is enjoying is â€œnever brewedâ€, therefore starting the poem in a
sort of a suspense as to what the poet is talking about. The next three lines
further increase the suspense regarding what the poet is talking about.The mystery of this alpha alcohol is solved in the second
stanza. She says that she is â€œInebriateâ€ of the â€œairâ€ and â€œdewâ€. These words
clearly show that she is talking of the nature that
surrounds her. She enjoys the â€œendless summer daysâ€ and the â€œmolten Blueâ€,
which is the sky. The â€œReelingâ€ shows us the extent of her intoxication. It
seems that the poet has lost control of herself, and an imagery of the world
reeling around her is created, sending the reader also into a reeling
experience.In the third stanza the poet compares herself to the other creatures,
such as the Bees and the Butterflies. These could be references to other beings
who are intoxicated by their own interests, but her intoxication by nature
exceeds all such cases.&nbsp; the usage of
bees and butterflies, adds to the reference of nature in the poem. The
exclamation at the end of the stanza presents a sort of a mockery to those who
get drunk easily. She sort of suggests that her drinking&nbsp; has only just begun.The final stanza is a continuation of the previous stanza. â€œSeraphsâ€ are angels of the highest order in
Christian mythology. This reference to religion is significant, since Christianity
is a religion that believes that Man is above nature, and it is present only to
serve man. Hence Nature is demystified by angels and saint. But the poet rebels
against this idea, and promotes the beauty and pleasure of nature. She brings nature up to a pedestal, high enough to be crazy over. Further, she lauds
herself, by saying that she is going to get so drunk that even Angels and
Saints would look back to see her â€œleaning against the Sunâ€. This shows that the poet is ready to throw a challenge to those who hold ideas other than the one that the poem holds, about nature.&nbsp;







The poem is very interesting in its usage of Dickinsonâ€™s
famous dashes. There doesn't
seem to be a set pattern, which accentuates the drunken state of the poet. Therefore, the reading of the poem also gives a sense of drunkenness to the reader. The
exclamation points used, in both situations, have a deeper meaning that just
surprise, which is very amusing to the reader. This humour
adds to the reading experience.&nbsp;

Love the title you've picked...it's a keeper, and it certainly grabbed my attention and drew me in. I think you've got a fairly good grasp on much of what the NY Style of poets are about, especially regards the ""I did this, I did that"" mode of writing, on which O'Hara has relied heavily in this poem. Because this is such a challenging poem about a rather enigmatic poet, I found the Peer Review Evaluation/Feedback questions and optional considerations particularly enlightening and helpful and have been suggesting to every essayist I review, that exploring them, and especially, viewing the video linked within, is a worthwhile endeavour.  I enjoyed reading your essay. I hope you enjoy the video Prof Filreis and the TA's have created to further explore this poem.

Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
The essay does describebhow version two isbshorter but more clear and understanding then version one.  The essay always notices some grammar like when they talk about wjawhat does the woman actually mean by certain things. The writer also shows how version two is more clear and shows you a good photograph in your head by what the writer is telling us.

This is an excellent essay that deals precisely and explicitly with the five points of the credo of the Imaginist manifesto.  The writer explains in detail how the grammar of the first version is streamlined and made more exact with the second, removing unnecessary parts of speech. The underlying message is clearly put --  fewer words: more is less here as is shown in the essay.  The condensation in the second poem more powerfully brings home the poet's poem with a few clear select images. In section 5 there is an interesting nod toward iconic Christian pose -- Madona and child.  This might be a ""Make It New"" approach but I found the interpretation given during the web cam of a mother with Williams' illegitimate child more in keeping with modern imagery.

4. Does the essay in some way follow the poem's shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the essay account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so?&nbsp;

I think it is very interesting that this essay makes connections within and outside the contexts of the poem. The references to Whitman, Buddhism and Tennyson is effective and shows clear understanding of suggesting a place beyond the confines of the words. Well done for not simply re-narrating the poem, but making very poignant points about the language and metaphor in each line. The most interesting part for me is this theory of a ""happy suicide"", where the all natural Sun is the object to kill her in the end. You could have mentioned the dashes and the form of the stanzas a little more, possibly referring to any particular patterns? It was also very perceptive of you to pick up on the fragility of the poem, and how Dickinson's words can be applied to modern times.

The discussion is thorough and goes through each of the stanzas of the poem. Although several images are discussed, it does however remain rather a paraphrasing of the poem. There is little discussion of the higher level processes going on, in particular the alingment of content and form (through aliteration, resembling the drunkard's slurred speach) or the shifting of the metaphors, corresponding to the increasing level of inebriation.

53762,1383985911,"You are quite welcome, but actually the post was quite interesting throughout.There
 is somewhere on the web, and I wish I could remember where or had 
bookmarked it, a poem which is essentially many of these sorts of 
sentences, some relating to several people who appear again and again, 
some without much context, which are I believe sorted in a random order 
when you go to the page and then served in that order as you click 
through them. I think there are 99 or some such number.But the 
experience your piece had me thinking of was taking a box of random 
objects, gathered through my childhood and having enough significance 
that I can remember where they came from, and why I saved them, and 
taking them out of the box one by one, and, when the box was empty, 
putting them back in again.The experience of reading Hejinian definitely varies based on familiarity with the text.The
 association of sentence with object makes me also think of the idea of 
systems of divination, I Ching or especially Tarot. One can do tarot 
readings with any sort of objects, if one has a vocabulary or can create
 a vocabulary in which these objects are ""words,"" as one does with tarot
 cards.I think Daniel Bergmann might have some amazing insights 
into what you are talking about, so if anyone happens to have his 
contact information, maybe they could direct him here. I have a lot of 
autism spectrum traits, and one thing that I think belongs among those 
is being hyperaware of how one's brain is working.There are also
 some interesting intersections of poetry with sculpture that can create
 different geometries than the linearity of a flat page for ""reading"" textual information.When
 I begin writing a poem, I cannot compose on a computer, and lined paper
 is a major distraction. I need blank paper, where I can put words in at
 least a full two-dimensional space on the page, possibly with different
 handwritings, and maybe in slightly different directions.Once I
 get going, my process becomes linear, but maybe I could train myself to
 write non-linear poetry. My goal in writing poetry is to evoke or 
communicate emotion, usually to say in words what is impossible to say 
in words, so Hejinian and Silliman are much more to my taste than many 
of the more radical experimental poets we are looking at.I think
 the statement ""different words are superior to each other"" sounds like 
something Yogi Berra would say, or like something from ""A Hole Is to Dig.""
 I am not quite sure how you would set up a scale to even argue that one
 word was superior to another. Has the letter earliest in the alphabet? 
Is longer? Is shorter? But thinking about how a word leads to another 
sounds like a good exercise.Flocking behaviour in birds, the way
 the waveform of a flock of birds flows like a screensaver, can be 
modeled by having birds try to keep close to their two nearest 
neighbors. What is flocking of words like?Are you familiar with Edward Gorey? Especially ""The Object Lesson"" relates to this post. A lot of his work calls causality into question.",2.0

As an autodidact I am always thrilled to read something that teaches me something new.  And I certainly was gratified in reading this essay to learn about slant rhyme as demonstrated by pearl and alcohol in the first stanza.    I was also thrilled to learn a synonym for juxtaposition in the use of the word collocation.  This was the first essay that I read that had an explanation regarding the double ""en"" dashes used throughout the poem and its use in creating a visual image of a person under the influence of alcohol.    It was also interesting to ponder the poetess attempting to break free of the bonds of social convention or as pointed out in this essay her own superego.    This was an excellent essay on a marvelous poem.

Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay.Â We have included an optional set of questions that you may use when reading your peers' essays.

    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.

At the first stanza of the poem Dickinson says about an extremely tastefull liquor, hard to find and she seems to enjoy the experience. At the time Dickinson lived it was inappropriate for a woman to drink alcohol but she is not afraid to write for it and she doesn't care how society could judge her.At the second stanza she is inebriated of Air &nbsp;with capital A and debauchee of Dew with capital D which shows the charm of the nature and the power it has on her. But also i think she gets sad and feels powerless just like alcohol makes you feel sometimes and she is reeling through the hot summer days that seem endless and she can do nothing to avoid it. Next stanza is full of metaphors with bugs (bees, butterflies) and i think she is talking about vicious, malevolent people (compared with bees which have the sting and cause harm) and unconcerned ostensible people. And when all these people dissapear from her life she would be able to drink more, she is going to be free and the bad things of her social life will be away.At the end of the poem, in the last line the tippler is going to the sun which represents the light, the life and the eternity. The sun is a &nbsp;metaphor for the wisdom, the peacefull life and only someone sensitized with nature and inebriated with air can gain that.

Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
I agree. I like to work harder to get my conclusions. Very thorough job.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I
taste a liquor never brewed, / From tankards scooped in pearl; This
beginning to the first stanza implies that what Dickinson is â€œingestingâ€ is
even more exquisite than the finest of liquors. It is also possible that she
means that it is impossible for the liquor she enjoys to be contained in a
tankard. Not all the vats upon the Rhine
/ Yield such an alcohol! The Rhine is a river that runs through Germany.
Germany; of course, is known for its alcohol. In saying this, Dickinson means
that the drunkenness she experiences is more than that which could be contained
in a multitude of vats in Germany. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inebriate of air am I, / And debauchee of
dew, It is here that Emily reveals that the alcohol she tastes is truly the
elation of being in nature. She is intoxicated by air and dew, and; presumably,
all things in nature. Reeling, through
endless summer days, / From inns of molten blue. In this, Dickinson says
that sheâ€™s reeling; drunk through endless summer days; the eternal beauty and
exhilaration of nature. The second line, I think means that the sky is the inn;
the tavern from which she drinks. The sky is molten blue, because her senses
are heightened. She is exhilarated in nature, and everything seems better. The
sky&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;just blue- itâ€™s molten
blue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When landlords turn the drunken bee / Out of
the foxgloveâ€™s door, / When butterflies renounce their drams, / I shall but
drink the more! I really enjoy this stanza. Emily writes that she will
still continue drinking, even after bees are â€œdrunkâ€ from flowers (the
foxgloves), and the butterflies are finished drinking nectar. It seems that she
is saying that she can continue drinking in nature longer than bees and
butterflies; the very products of nature. The power in the exhilaration she
feels from being in nature is more compelling than a beeâ€™s need for flowers, or
a butterflyâ€™s need for nectar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till seraphs swing their snowy hats, / And
saints to windows run, / To see the little tippler / Leaning against the sun! I
feel like this stanza is a continuation of the previous one; that Emily is
further explaining when she will stop drinking in nature. (A seraph is an angel
of a very high standing.) She writes that she will drink in nature until angels
and saints rush to see her, drunk in delight. This could mean that she wonâ€™t
stop drinking until she sees angles and saints (death.) Or, it could mean that
she will continue to drink forever, because seraphs and saints will never want
to see her personally. I think that the last line, leaning against the sun,
means that she is dependent on the sun, the driving force of nature and light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
thing that is particularly interesting to me is that Emily only tastes the liquor. She&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;constantly drink it, though it seems that she thinks she does. Perhaps she
means that very rarely does she get the opportunity to get outside and freely
drink in nature, but when she does, it feels as if she will be doing so
forever.

    For mesostics and essays written by students choosing Option A:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext (""seed text""), the spine, and the resulting mesostic? How does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtapositions?
    2. What does this essay have to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?
    For writing experiments and essays written by students choosing Option B:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing? Does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtaposition(s) between
        the original and the ""written-through"" experiment?
    2. Does the writer have something to say about this kind of ""writing through"" a previous text, or about aleatory or ""unoriginal"" poetry generally? Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?

I found the second poem much more successful (and readable) than the first. An interesting choice since you basically have to remove the main topic (""slant"") from the poem. It has the effect, for me, of making the poem feel a little more open and suggestive than the original. I would have liked a little more analysis from your essay, though, as you just begin to comment on how the changes affect the meaning. And given the revelation you mention in your last line, I'm curious as to exactly how the experiment impacted your awareness of language? All in all, a good exercise, thanks for sharing.

Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay.Â We have included an optional set of questions that you may use when reading your peers' essays. Use these questions
        as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. We have also recorded a video discussion of ""Why I Am Not a Painter."" If you can, watch this recording
        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


I share your conclusion that there are more similarities than differences between poetry and painting. And I enjoy your parallel with the imagism as a way to draw poet and painter closer. Well done!

Peer review instructions: use your peer review to assess and comment on your peers' essays. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay. We have recorded a video discussion of ""Young Woman at a Window."" 
Listen to this recording before you write your reviews. It will
 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Beautifully written. I really like how you've analysed the role of different parts of speech in the poem and you've been very observant in noticing the finer nuances of word-play. Your essay was absolutely brilliant and a delight to read.

3. Does the essay account in some way for the stanzaic form of the poem? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay discuss how the poem's form interacts with its content? Does the essay, for example, describe the way in which the speaker's figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble?
4. Does the essay in some way follow the poem's shifts in metaphor or conceit?

Does the essay account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so?Â 
The author has taken notice of the elements of modernity in Dickinson:  the coherence of form of meaning, with examples of ''Inebriate of air --"" and a ""Debauchee of Dew --''. This is important for Dickinson's poems.

This is an interesting format to write your essay in. I enjoy your thoughts and connections on certain lines I would have liked it more if you quoted the poem less and just chose certain passages to elaborate on instead of speaking vaguely about the whole poem. Nice thoughts though!

You've really captured ED's sense of exuberance -- that she is ""completely enthralled"" and demonstrates this to the reader with her word choice and shifting array of metaphors. (Surely she would have loved your mention of the nectar in the golden snapdragon blossoms!) You've also captured her clever way of drawing in the reader with riddles and play. Part of the pleasure of reading Dickinson is that her poems can be satisfying on many levels. You have shown that ""I taste a liquor"" can be read and richly enjoyed as a poem of nature and faith.

I found your newly created poem to flow rather well, and it even surprised me few times with my mind generating relationships between words ( Ratial Definitions Skin) ( Work, Agendas, Our Society) (Religion Proof of That).

I am not sure, why this happened. But your essay has been copied twice here. Doesn't matter. 

The essay is very amazing in its interpretations. The gender perspective in the 5th para where you have compared 'Landlords' with men and 'Drunken bee' as women (like herself and others) is quite interesting. Emily Dickinson's use of words like 'Molten Blue' is indeed vivid which you have rightly acknowledged. I am not sure if the use of 'Foxglove' can be linked to your explanation. Yet, that adds to my knowledge. So, thanks for that. Great job.

I particularly enjoyed the way you drew my attention to prepositions in the second poem and the way they build up the picture in the reader's head. I prefer the first poem, but I am as persuaded by this essay as I ever will be of the highly wrought nature of the second. An 'A' from me.

    For mesostics and essays written by students choosing Option A:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext (""seed text""), the spine, and the resulting mesostic? How does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtapositions?
    2. What does this essay have to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?
    For writing experiments and essays written by students choosing Option B:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing? Does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtaposition(s) between
        the original and the ""written-through"" experiment?
    2. Does the writer have something to say about this kind of ""writing through"" a previous text, or about aleatory or ""unoriginal"" poetry generally? Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?

Thank you for including the original poem by Frost.  I agree with your conclusions about the mesostic versions.  We all seem to be agreeing that the meaning remains much the same in our new versions of the poems.  But now I will go back and question if this is a good thing.  Does this mean that the first poem was too wordy?  And I like you concluded that this form is very open-ended.

We have listed four questions below that can be used as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. We have also recorded an audio-only discussion of ""I taste a liquor never brewed."" Listen to this recording before you answer the rubric questions: it will provide you with an example of how to close read Dickinson's poem. You can find the link to the recording here.
1.Â Does the essay do more than paraphrase the poem? In other words, does the essay quote the words used by the poet? We say in ModPo that ""how a poem says what it says is more important than what it says."" Does the essay convey the ""how"" of the poem as much as - or more than - the ""what""? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay do this?
2.Â Does the essay say something about how Dickinson's dashes works? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay deal with the dashes?
3. Does the essay account in some way for the stanzaic form of the poem? How effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does the essay discuss how the poem's form interacts with its content? Does the essay, for example, describe the way in which the speaker's figurative drunkenness makes the poem itself reel or lurch forward or wander or wobble?
4. Does the essay in some way follow the poem's shifts in metaphor or conceit? Does it somehow explain why Dickinson decides not to stick with the metaphor of the tavern or pub at the beginning of the poem? Does the essay account for the way the poem's language progresses/moves/shifts from beginning to end? To the extent that the essay deals with these matters, how effectively, significantly and/or interestingly does it do so?Â 
I particularly like the way out point out the different sorts of containers that are mentioned in the poem.  I had not noticed this at all and was immediately drawn to this point.  I wish you had extended this point.  Can we see the poem as a kind of container?  Can the idea of containment be linked to the condensation that you point to just after the discussion of containers.

You do an excellent job of describing and discussing the shifting metaphors as ED moves from nature to drinking and back again and I agree that this is a main strength of the poem.

I thought that the most insightful part of your essay was the idea that When ""Landlords"" turn the drunken Bee / Out of the Foxglove's door -"" was a way of referring to the end of summer.  I had not thought of that at all but it seemed obvious to me as soon as you pointed it out.  For me, as a reader, that was the best moment of your essay because it made me see the poem differently.

I liked your essay very much.

 provide you with an example of how to close read Williams's poem. You can find the video by clicking here.
There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition?

So I'm not sure your idea can totally be supported by the poem, but it's interesting nevertheless. And it's certainly by entertaining different possible readings that we can get to know the poems better so no ideas are wasted. Thanks for suggesting this one!&nbsp;",1.0

""This is a tricky one....""  The writer doesn't want to be told what to think and therefore resents the assignment.  It seems almost as if the writer sets up an evaluation system and purposefully drives toward coming to the opposite conclusion from the assignment, but is this rebellion only or is there some truth here?  It seems to me that the second is employing exact words and grammar, whereas the first is using subordinate clauses.  The subject in the first is the child; the subject in the second is the woman.  That's a pretty big difference, isn't it?  As to cadence, when I read the first poem I felt almost a sing songy cadence.  The second is more jerky.  This writer doesn't examine the cadence of the first as closely as the second, so I can't tell what he/she means by saying the first one is ""all over the place.""  I think the first has a pretty predictable cadence.  I agree that choice of subject is pretty much the same in both subjects:  mother and child.  I don't understand the writer's assertion that poem 1 has a more compelling image - to me, admittedly my opinion, poem 2 is more of a static image with no narration.  I'm at a loss, really, to ""evaluate"", and so my response is that if it can't be suggested that a poem is a certain type, and if we can't be asked to demonstrate the principles of a certain school of writing, what is the class for, anyway?  I recognize an originality in the irony of a scoring system applied to poetry, though, and maybe that was your point?

You interpret the poem as an expression of the authorÂ´s spiritual connection with god, which I think is perfectly valid. Interesting to me are your thoughts about the nature of the speakers intoxication. I thought about it as something solely ecstatic and ""positive"", while you describe it as possibly ""numb"" or causing an ""anesthetic feeling"" as well. If the speaker get numb from drinking the liquor, what does this imply about her spiritual aspirations? 
What you could improve upon in the essay is the analysis of form (IÂ´m not a good teacher here, as I didnÂ´t do it in my own essay).

I enjoyed your interpretation of the poem and your take on the valuable ""liquor""  as that of Dickinson's passion for writing. Am I correct in thinking that you see this as a meta-poem, or a poem about poetry and the passion behind the art of poetry? My take on the poem was that the speaker was ""drunk on nature"" in general, but your reading seems to touch on Dickinson's own personal nature -- I'm drunk on my own inner passion for poetry -- which is an interesting way to look at the poem that I hadn't considered. It is certainly understandable to believe that for Dickinson, words themselves were a sense of life, of breath. I like that idea. I agreed with your view that the Sun represents a sort of death, or total consumption. In your reading that would represent the end of her writing. That is a very powerful image -- imagining her writing until her last breath. 

By the way, I love your personal story about visiting her grave. I have been to Sylvia Plath's grave in England and I can appreciate the humility of being in that situation.

Do a close reading of the poem in short essay form.
In her poem ""I taste a liquor never brewed"", Emily
Dickinson utilizes the feeling of being drunk as a tasteful yet effective
metaphor for the euphoria that she experiences in connection with the natural
world. The poemâ€™s form is true to the Dickinsonian tradition in that the lines
are well thought out and rather condensed, attempting to convey large (and
sometimes open-ended) ideas to the reader while using a limited and somewhat
abbreviated medium.

The opening line of the first stanza is where the poemâ€™s namesake is
derived from. It is also where Dickinson initially presents us with the conceit
of intoxication that endures throughout the entirety of the poem. It is
interesting to note that as a poet, Dickinson is often jumpy with her metaphors
and prone to abandoning conceits as quickly as she introduces them, so the fact
that the concept of being â€œdrunkâ€ on nature and the world around remains present
and intact for the duration of this piece despite being approached from a
variety of vantage points across itâ€™s course is definitely a matter of
significance worthy of the readerâ€™s attention. 

The rest of the first stanza uses comparison to convey just how
valuable her â€œliquorâ€ is in relation to some of the finest and most expensive
alcohols known to humanity. I believe the use of the word â€œneverâ€ in the
opening line to be of the most consequence to the tone of the piece, as it implies
that no human could possibly have the capability or capacity to create
something as beautiful and tangibly powerful as what she is experiencing via nature.


The second stanza runs with this idea, describing (with a very
positive tone) some of the finer origins of Dickinsonâ€™s drunkenness (the air,
the dew, the sky, and the summer). Within those same lines, she also makes use
of words that more often than not have a rather negative connotation
(inebriate, debauchee, and reeling). The resulting juxtaposition that is
created is indicative of Dickinsonâ€™s attention to detail and her mastery over
her craft. â€œInns of molten blueâ€ furthers this concept, as an inn, often portrayed
as the dimly lit, dreary home of lifetime drunks, is presented as a blue sky
with color so rich and deep that it appears to be burning. It bears a striking
resemblance to the image of â€œthe Gambrels of the Skyâ€, found earlier in our
readings within Dickinsonâ€™s poem â€œI dwell in possibilityâ€. 

The third stanza develops the idea that Dickinson will increase the
level of her inebriation off of nature over time, even more so after the
butterflies and the bees have ceased to drink from it themselves (a very funny
allusion to the insects and their pollination of flowers). With this stanza the
reader receives the notion that Dickinson may be rather critical of the culture
surrounding alcohol and bars, evoking images of landlords kicking drunken
patrons from their establishments and ex-drinkers recalling their love for
their booze. Nature is presented as the fairer of the two worlds. 

The final stanza posits imagery of saints and angels (who appear to
be engaging in their own drunken merriment) gazing down from the sky and
watching Dickinson as she drinks in nature. The final line, â€œLeaning against
the sun!â€ is a humorous one, as lean was used a slang term for alcohol in her
day. It draws this piece to a close on a warm and inviting note.

On itâ€™s surface, this poem appears lighthearted in tone and positive
in language, but upon closer pruning there is definitely a darker and more
serious social commentary that exists within its confines. Using some
biographical context, Dickinsonâ€™s professed love of the natural world in this
poem seems inspired in part by her distaste for human behavior and her own
introversion. Overall, itâ€™s an interesting and multifaceted work of art, and an
enjoyable read. Shout out to Emily D.&nbsp;

    For mesostics and essays written by students choosing Option A:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext (""seed text""), the spine, and the resulting mesostic? How does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtapositions?
    2. What does this essay have to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?
    For writing experiments and essays written by students choosing Option B:
    1. Does the short explanatory essay speculate interestingly on the possible accidental relationship between the sourcetext and the deformed experimented-upon writing? Does it attempt to account for the meaning created by the juxtaposition(s) between
        the original and the ""written-through"" experiment?
    2. Does the writer have something to say about this kind of ""writing through"" a previous text, or about aleatory or ""unoriginal"" poetry generally? Does this essay have something remarkable to say about the virtues (and/or vices) of this mode of writing?

I think the person that did this mesostic exercise did a good job in his exercise even though he does not understand what came out of it! He at least attempted to try it and see the results. I did not try it since I did not understand the directions to attempt it. He finds that the exercise does not have meaning to him even after reading it over ten times. If I do something more than five times I tend to give up on it. I think the exercise this essay writer did shows that sometimes what a writer does and what he gets in the results are two different matters. He mentions 2 words show up in the stanzas-channel and Kimmel. I know channel and Jimmy Kimmel is a network and Jimmy Kimmel appears on late night television on a channel. Perhaps, this is the connection to the mesostic. Interesting how William Blake's name gets scattered throughout the prose poem!

The essay doesn't say a whole lot about the stanzas, dashes, etc., and the writing could have used a bit of editing. However, it does do more than paraphrase the poem. The author also makes a very interesting observation at the end, when s/he says that 'she [ED] sounds more progressively tipsy the more she writes,' noting the use of the word 'reel' to prove his/her point.

1. This essay is, more or less, a paraphrase, albeit a well written one. 
2. There is no mention of dashes. I didn't notice that was a requirement of the closed reading. I am forgiving the author of the above writing for this ommission. It doesn't in my opinion affect the high quality of the close reading. 

3. Stanzas are discussed briefly and in order. There is no specific mention of the movement forward, inward, or otherwise in the essay .

4. Shifts in metaphor are not really dealt with in detail here. Again, I don't mind. I like the writing as it is. I guess we will all be getting more experience with the proper writing of these assignments as the course progresses. A more than decent first effort. :).

I like the style of this essay and the way it is organised, each paragraph dealing with certain part of the poem or certain aspect. I think the author caught the meaning of the poem. And the main point of the poem - the alcoholic metaphor is highlighted. I like the honesty in admitting that the meaning of certain parts of the poem are not clear for the author. The idea of Emily as a rebel is very interesting and the phrase ""she has reached there levels in heaven, not as a saint or a pure angel, but rather, through her sophisticated approach to mischief: as a â€œTipplerâ€ seems to me as a rather unexpected approach but - again - very, very interesting.  The explanation of the use of dashes -  almost like hiccups sounds very good.

There are a number of specific ways in which version 2 of the Williams poem can be considered more imagist than version 1. If you want, look at the points in the imagist manifesto and ask yourself if the essay you are reviewing demonstrates how version 2 embodies these ideas. Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
Repeating the rules on the manifesto were nice to keep the essay on track. The ideas were great, but needed elaboration and to be thought through more. I think it would've spiced up the essay more with a few extra opinions of yours, and also by talking about how the form of the poem reflects imagist ideals. You talked briefly about the condensation and grammar of the piece, but could have developed ideas more on that. Overall, the essay was pretty good.

        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


I think you did a great job saying why he is a poet and not a painter. I feel like at times you were just restating the poem versus really looking between the lines for the meaning. But in the end, your conclusion does a nice job of explaining that he understands more about poetry than painting, good job!

Very clever and clear comparison between the Imagist manifesto and two versions. The advantage to compare the manifesto with two versions one by one, is that you hardly miss any important points, while the disadvantage is that you may not able to analyze the differences in a more systematic way, and at the same time you may miss the chance to explore something more beyond the manifesto. Anyway, I like this essay very much for its clarity and succinctness.

Below we have provided you with five questions you can also - or alternatively - ask about the essay you are reviewing.Â  Use these questions as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all (or, if you wish, none) of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. Here now are those questions, intended as an optional guide:
1. Condensation: Does the essay note that version 2 is shorter than version 1? If so, how fully, convincingly and/or interestingly does the essay explain how and where the condensation has occurred?
2. Grammar: Does the essay note the basic difference in the grammar between the two versions? Each is a complete sentence. The first version uses a ""While""-clause, setting up a logical condition: (while this happens, [then/therefore] that happens). Thus the logical flow of the first version works on a hinge â€“ a turn that happens as the word ""this"" in ""this little child."" If Williams used punctuation, a comma would go after ""her hand"" and before ""this little child."" The second version, however, uses no conditional logic. It moves directly from the sitting to the window. Does the essay notice these things? Does the essay explain or account for these differences?
3. Prepositions: Does the essay note that the second version uses a great many prepositions (""with,"" ""on,"" ""in,"" ""to"") and that these are positional or position-setting words? The second version uses prepositions to create a scene or location and sets up positional relationships between and among its parts. How well or interestingly does the essay remark on the prepositions and their effects?
4. Subjectivity: Now for a difficult aspect of the poem. One of the mysteries of the poem (in both versions) is the position or location (or ""subjectivity"") of the speaker. Where is he? Who is he? He seems to be looking into the scene, possibly from the outside. For example, does the speaker in any way make us think about the missing member of this family? We see a ""young woman"" and a child; it seems possible that she is the mother of the child. A few readers might wonder if there is a father ""in the picture,"" as it were. Has the father of the child left them alone? Is he perhaps the speaker? How does version 2 treat the subjectivity or identity of the speaker differently than version 1? An essay that remarks on the problem of the speaker's identity or subjectivity in the poem should be praised!
5. Tradition: A few interpreters might want to say (as some critics have) that the woman and infant remind us of the iconic Christian pose â€“ Madonna and child. This would suggest symbolism and a nod at â€“ or possibly an ironic remaking of â€“ this kind of traditional painterly meaning. Someone arguing that either version of the poem is imagist might point out a ""Make It New"" approach to the tradition. Does the essay happen to mention this? It's fair not to expect an essay on the poem to mention this, but if it does mention it, we hope you will take note.Â  Does the essay identify such a ""quotation"" from traditional iconography as a modernist turn against tradition? In general, does such a mention support the goal of identifying imagist aspects of this writing?Â 
This essay hits most of the main points of the imagist approach and why the 2nd poem is more in that tradition, but does not deal with prepositions or the subjectivity issue.  The comments on the poem's visualization of the mother and child are especially perceptive and interesting.

I especially love your engagement with the concept of authorship in your essay â€” you really have a good understanding of what these poets are trying to say about authorship and subjectivity, and that really came through both in your poem and in your reading of your poem. I think the best way to understand conceptual poetry is to try writing a conceptual poem for yourself, and this essay demonstrates how much you can learn from writing a poem and then thinking critically about what you've created. I hope lots of others read this excellent work!Â Great job! [REDACTED]",1.0

    Peer review instructions: Use your peer review to comment on the ways in which your peers' essays approach this poem. Emphasize what you think the essay does well; what you find interesting or thought provoking about the essay; and what questions you find yourself asking after reading the essay.Â We have included an optional set of questions that you may use when reading your peers' essays. Use these questions
        as a general guide to your peer review: answer any or all of these questions, and of course feel free to comment on aspects of the essay not listed here. We have also recorded a video discussion of ""Why I Am Not a Painter."" If you can, watch this recording
        before you answer the optional questions; it will provide you with an example of how to close read O'Hara's poem. You can find the link to the video here.Optional considerations:
    1. Form: Does the essay explain how the poem's form expresses O'Hara's apparent preference for being a poet? (When we use the word ""how,"" we emphasize the importance of thinking about what a poem does â€“ how it uses its formal elements â€“ as much
        as we think about what it says.)
    2. Painting vs. poetry: Does the essay identify ways in which writing a poem is different from painting a painting, in O'Hara's view? Does the essay, for example, compare the poem by O'Hara called ""Oranges"" and the painting by Mike Goldberg called Sardines? How successful and/or interesting is the comparison?
    3. New York School: As an option, the essay might integrate into its discussion observations about the ""New York School"" style of I-do-this-I-do-that. Does the essay attempt to explain why the I-do-this-I-do-that style is well suited to such a large and theoretical or abstract
        discussion of differences between two arts?
    4. Meta-poetry:Â  As an option, the essay might emphasize the orientation to process in O'Hara's writing. Does the essay, for instance, see a possible irony in the sentence ""My poem / is finished and I haven't mentioned / orange yet"" or in O'Hara's quoting Mike
        Goldberg asserting that his ""painting is / finished""? What we're asking here is whether the essay addresses the ""meta-poetic"" qualities of O'Hara's poem: the poem is a poem about a painting; it is also a poem about the poet's preference for poetry.


Your conclusion is intriguing (O'Hara is not a painter merely because he is a poet) and I am enjoying mulling this over. You touch on the grammar (tenses) in the poem. You do not seem to discuss the metapoetic quality of the poem (nor did I!). Your discussion of the parallel but unique stories painting and poetry tells is very interesting. You do not mention the New York school, but it does not at all detract from your essay. It  may have been good to include some other specific lines from the poem that enabled you to reach your conclusion. Overall, a well rounded essay and a pleasure to read!
