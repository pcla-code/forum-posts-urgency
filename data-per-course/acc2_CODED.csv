5490,1412012099,"[REDACTED],As I understand it the transaction recorded during the period in question would be:Dr. Accounts Payable (-L) Â  Â 400Â  Â  Cr. Cash (-A) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  400So... how do you interpret the question. Option 1 is to posit that the inventory transaction doesn't show up because the transaction is cash and accounts payable. Option 2: However, the cash contribution to the SCF will decrease during that period (based upon payment of a prior inventory sale) because that transaction debits a $400 liability with cash. Even looking at the income statement which would subtract cash (credit a debit account) and also subtract accounts payable (debit a credit account), when translating this to the SCF you would credit the Accounts Payable account in the SCF ledger to recognize that the cash was deducted from the cash debit account.My guess, although I didn't have that question, would be to pick the second interpretation, i.e. how did it affect the SCF ledger, as it conforms more closely with the 'spirit of the week's lectures'. The interpretation of the intent of the question here would be to draw a distinction between the Income Statement and the Statement of Cash FlowsI'm having problems interpreting the intent of some of the questions on the quizes as well Â :(",5

It could be argued that these are not part of the core performance of a business: Next year the company could refinance and get better interest rates or hire a clever tax accountant and pay less taxes.Operating CF also does not include depreciation and amortization. If the company intends to perform on the same level in the future, it will have to replenish its resources and spend cash for that.So you could argue that EBITDA is a good approximation of the cash flow related to the core business.

5203,1411738068,"Long time-reader, first-time poster here.The discussion about how to account for the euphemistic ""non-revenue sales"" (AKA theft) and the write-down of inventory to fair market value prodded me to think about the accounting treatment for other scenarios where product spoils without making its way to a sale. I'm not sure I have a question here; I'm more summarizing some scenarios to ensure I have the right intuition.Some examples include:1. Raw materials or products that expire prior to sale.2. Zero yield of a manufacturing process...say an entire vat of ketchup is unintentionally purple and thus must be disposed of (because my marketing team wasn't creative enough to call purple a feature and charge a premium for it).Â  Â - I assume in both cases we Dr. COGS &amp; Cr. Inventory for the entire amount to write the assets off.3. Poor yield of a manufacturing process...say I invest the resources to otherwise produce 1000 goods, but 950 are defective, so I have effectively produced 50 very expensive goods for the price of 1000. (Not uncommon in semiconductor manufacturing, for instance.)Â  - I assume this is similar to the above, but instead of an adjustment writing off the entire batch, we write off a portion of it using the same Lower-of-Cost-or-Market method, but the FMV is this time a value greater than zero (as above), but less than the Historical Cost.The net of all these transactions is that there is no affect on LIFO vs FIFO (since I won't have any artificially high-priced inventory, courtesy of the Lower-of-Cost-or-Market) treatment. In short, we take ""the hit"" for the poor yield or expired inventory right in the quarter it is discovered so that quarter's COGS is higher than it would otherwise be and earnings suffer.This begs the question...what controls are typically in place to ensure a company's management doesn't willfully ""fail to discover"" the expired inventory so they can keep earnings up?Is my intuition basically sound on the above?",4

Part of this was what [REDACTED] says- if my business becomes large, most external accountants use QuickBooks so I wanted something that was standard- at least in the US. Also it was only around $US 200 and the interface is very user friendly- you just click buttons such as ""add a vendor/supplier"", pay a vendor, send a customer an invoice- and the software does all the debits and credits and creates new ledger accounts as needed.I know people who are self-employed who used EXCEL to run their business accounting since they were NOT set up as a separate legal entity. In the USA, if you are not concerned with customers suing you and coming after your assets or not concerned with having your company fail and ruin your own credit scores then you can run your business as a self-employed and not be a separate entity. Here you use Tax Schedule C to record your business income or Tax Schedule E to record your real estate business income.

7960,1414412814,"Huge companies often don't invest heavily, and the S&amp;P 500 are huge companies. Â There are many reasons for this: conservative management practices, hard to find large-scale investment projects, lots of bureaucracy, etc. Â Apple is a good example: since the iPhone, all of its investments have been small tweaks to the iPhone (and its big brother, the iPad). Â Much of the breakthrough investments come from small companies that are willing to take risks and do not have an entrenched market position (or fat and happy execs). Â Those companies also barely eke out positive cash flows. Â So, the tax breaks help provide companies like ""1980 Apple"" the incentives to invest because they need the tax breaks. Â Companies like ""2014 Apple"" don't need the tax breaks because they are profitable enough to pay for hot shot tax consultants that figure out other ways to avoid paying taxes.",2

You may just be calculating wrong. I do not know if I got it right as I just finished part 2 with 6 out of 8 on second try. I found the mid term quite challenging even tho I did quite well on the weekly homework assignments.  Did 10.4 out of 12 on part 1.  A bit disappointed I didn't do better but overall satisfied.  I think the questions were all fair and accurately written. Mistakes were all my own.

When we say operating cash flow we mean real money that we really received or spent. All these amounts account for in an account ""Cash"". But Operating section of SCF that is calculated by indirect method includes specific components (not cash) that are used to transform Net Income to operating cash flow.That's why $40 Loss is included to Operating section of SCF as a specific component, but $40 is not cash flow at all.

I mean, I think that at each period of time, the interest could be accounted as an increase in your liabilites (because now you have to pay a little bit more for your house).

5904,1412355353,"So, for me, this topic is where Financial Accounting is on a collision course with the 'Real World'. It seems to me that the motivation for each of these transactions 'should be' that the 'company' values (needs) cash more than the value (net present value) the market places on it.Â As I understand it all of these transactions limits the maximum loss of the 'company' to the actual value of the commited Accounts Receivable with the second two being certain loss, i.e. actual sale.So, on the face of it all three are the same after considering cost of collection and reasonableness of collection estimate.Factoring and Securitization in fact are the same from the point of view of the company selling the Accounts Receivable to another entity. The place where it seems to get strange is that the Variable Interest Entity is in fact a subsidiary of the 'company'!!!So my question is whether the company sells its Accounts Receivable to the Variable Interest Entity and receives in return an Accounts Receivable commitment from the Variable Interest Entity considering the VIE couldn't possibly have sold 'shares' in the Accounts Receivable acquired from the 'company' to generate cash until after the VIE actually owned them.Â If this is the case what did the 'company' accomplish considering the structure of the journal entry would probably have taken the form:Dr. Accounts Receivable (+A)Â  Â  Cr. Accounts Receivable (-A)If the VIE partner is in fact a financial institution, such as a bank, that is willing to front the cash to pay the 'company' so the transaction looks like:Dr. Cash (+A)Â  Â  Cr. Accounts Receivable (-A)Why is this at all different from Factoring???Does this question make sense???",5
