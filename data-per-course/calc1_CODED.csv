3481,1372795993,"Reanimation disease is based on
supposed happenings during the 16 and 1700s via a junk style of
plague that was said to have started in lower Asia, working its way
across Asia to Europe finally settling in Europe starting in the
1600s from the 1200s.


This plague was said once caught to
make a person sick with a malaise style of fever, then into a comma
with death as an end result. The body was then interred. 



With the passage of the few days the
thought of as being dead clawed their way out of their earthen graves
to return to their villages in a stultified but apparently alive
state to be with family members.
When the sun set, these changed family
members bit other family members and this is how said plague invested
in Europe.


The military was assembled and the
numbers of the reanimated were found and extinguished from their half
way between life and death existances. These were not zombies, but
another style of being who is it said had physiologically changed
teeth.


There were also many people that after
being bitten, were able to overcome their sickness by sheer luck or
divine providence. After they had recovered and procreated, it was
said that the children were able to heard these undead from where
they were hiding and with dogs men with torches being armed, were
able to find the last of these plague sorts and dispatch them,


These plague sorts are not known as the
clans.


The estimated then in Europe was on the
guessed order of twenty thousand bitten, maybe a bit more, but with
half of these surviving. Remember this battle goes from the 1600s to
the 1700s as at that time there was no electronic frontier to be able
to communicate data quickly to where the infected might be hiding.


Time had passed and many of these who
had survived but held the gene scar trait, settled in many other
parts of the world. Maybe a lot of them in America. So these
imigrants had children and their children had children and so on.
However the trait of resistance to the reanimation disease was
carried on as a hidden gene trait.


Other saids that a zombie virus that
has the same starter pattern exist in cold vault storage.
It would be estimated that a certain
part of the population would not have this resistance.
Note that now the population of the few
thousands who carry this resistance trait, are probably now in the
modern era, vested in the many millions.


How zombie virus differs from junk
vampire virus, is while the starter trait is the same, with sickness
malaise high fever and death, there is a y function to where either a
vampire is formed, or a zombie is made.


A full viral zombie in theory is a
being that has its basic body and neurological functions intact, but
their higher brain function is arrested and even virally let to
neglect. So the flesh and the body begins to rot, which only the
basal metabolism urges this being to eat subsistence of the flesh, as
this is the only food source that supplies it the raw energy that it
needs.


So to make the math equation stance,
the formula would be, the many decedents of people from the junk
vampire plagues, that are now in differing locations that carry this
past gene scar, which would make them resistant to a viral zombie's
bite, as opposed to people who have no past protection against the
viral zombie bite, as their protection factor is not within their
heritage?


This is the true statistics and the
probable format of this mythical affiliation.


Note I had&nbsp;read an article in FATE
Magazine to where a woman as a child while living on a plantation in
the lower south of the U.S. Was told not to go near an apparent
zombie worker gang based on that plantation. She had been told in no
uncertain terms, that if she became too close to these men because of
their nutrition requirements, that events could take a sudden course
to disaster.


These types of zombies are narcoleptic
by voodoo zombies in order to work off a debt. But I still believe
the telling was accurate.


A narcoleptic Zombie would be much
different than a viral zombie, but it seems that both mythologies are
based in a bit of truth.


There probably would not be a one
hundred percent turn rate with all people turned into viral zombies.

1246,1370002370,"There seems to be various views on which numbers are real, rational etc. I believe the actual question has been answered - sin(1) is merely shorthand and conventionally would be regarded as meaning 1 radian (unless for example the statement 'all angles are quoted in degrees' was included somewhere). So example x is normally the same as example z. But in some answers above radians (or angles in general) are said to not be real numbers. In my view this could be misleading. A number is a number. When an angle (or anything else) is expressed it is often done so in terms of a number (ie n degrees or m radians where n &amp; m are numbers). Assuming this is the case then we can discuss whether n or m are real numbers. They may not be, They could be imaginary (eg sin(i)). But otherwise they are real. Whether they are integers, rational etc is a different matter. If we had sin(sqrt3) then the number part preceding the implied 'radians' is irrational but it is still real. As an aside when in place of a number we use a variable (eg sin(x)) then often it is necessary to state whether x is real etc. to place limits or 'boundaries' on the possible outcomes.. ",3

\[ a = (1,2,1,3,4,5,\ldots)\]
then we have
\[ Ea = (2,1,3,4,5,\ldots)\quad\text{and}\quad Ia = (1,2,1,3,4,5,\ldots).\]
The operator $$\lambda I$$ multiplies each element by $$\lambda$$.  So we would have
\[ 3Ia = (3,6,3,9,12,15,\ldots)\]
and more generally
\[\lambda I a = (\lambda,2\lambda,\lambda,3\lambda,4\lambda,5\lambda,\ldots).\]
The operator $$E-\lambda I$$ thus takes a sequence and subtracts the scaled version from the left shifted version:
\[(E-3I)a = (-1,-5,0,-5,-7,\ldots)\]
and more generally
\[ (E-\lambda I)a = (2-\lambda, 1-2\lambda,3-\lambda,4-3\lambda,5-4\lambda,\ldots).\]Thus $$\Delta$$ is just $$E-\lambda I$$ when $$\lambda =1$$.",2

5007,1375666470,"[REDACTED], it seems that many of us struggle with the course horribly (I, for one, gave up on doing Challenge Homework and almost at the point of giving up on Chapter 4). I am certain that a lot of people would really appreciate another session, because it would allow us to dive deeper into the rich material that you present and vanquish your treacherous Challenge Homework (and Calculus as a whole!).",3

3822,1373367027,"Please be careful: Wolfram Alpha is not bug free (as every software ever written). Take this example: the linear ODE from lesson 19. Let's use a more simple example, using the constants a and b as the functions A and B:
\[\frac{dx}{dt}=ax+b\]
Using the integrant factor, this equation is solved:
\[x=e^{at+c_1}\int be^{-at-c_1}dx\]
which is
e^(at+c)*integral(b*e^(-at-c))
in Wolfram Alpha.
Well, try put that formula in Alpha, you can check in the results that the input matches the integral we want, but the solution according to it is $$-\frac{b}{a}$$ , while we all know it is
\[c_2e^{at+c_1} -\frac{b}{a}=Ce^{at} -\frac{b}{a}\]

So, it appears that Alpha is simply ignoring the integral constant $$c_2$$, resulting in the disappearance of an important term.Edit: corrected by suggestion of [REDACTED].",3

5762,1377319961,"Here's how I think about the arcsin example. &nbsp;The key assertion is that when $$x={1 \over 10}$$, $$a_{n+1}&lt;\frac{a_n}{1000}$$ for $$n\geq3$$ from the other coefficients. &nbsp;I think that is wrong. &nbsp;I think the other coefficients net to about $$1$$ and we only pick up $${1 \over 100}$$ of accuracy per additional term so that&nbsp;$$a_{n+1}&lt;\frac{a_n}{100}$$, although we still only need to go out to the $$x^7$$ term to get the desired accuracy. &nbsp; If we start by assuming that&nbsp;$$a_{n+1}&lt;\frac{a_n}{100}$$&nbsp;(I'll come back to showing that at the end), then&nbsp;\[\begin{array}{l}a_{N+1}&lt;\frac{a_N}{100}\\a_{N+2}&lt;\frac{a_{N+1}}{100}&lt;\frac{a_N}{100^2}\\a_{N+3}&lt;\frac{a_{N+2}}{100}&lt;\frac{a_{N+1}}{100^2}&lt;\frac{a_N}{100^3}\\\text{etc}\end{array}\]Therefore:\[E_N=\sum_{n=N+1}^\infty a_n &lt; a_N \sum_{n=N+1}^\infty (\frac{1}{100})^{n-N}=a_N \sum_{n=1}^\infty&nbsp;(\frac{1}{100})^n\]But we know that the right side is a geometric series so we know that:\[E_N&lt;a_N \sum_{n=1}^\infty&nbsp;(\frac{1}{100})^n=a_N (\frac{1}{1-{1 \over 100}}-1)=a_N{1 \over 99}\approx a_N {1 \over 100}\]Note that when $$x={1 \over 10}$$, $$a_3 = \frac{1*3*5}{2*4*6} {1 \over 7}({1 \over 10})^7={15 \over 336}10^{-7}&lt;10^{-8}$$. &nbsp;Therefore:&nbsp;\[E_3&lt;a_3 {1 \over 100}&lt;10^{-8}{1 \over 100}=10^{-10}\]which is the desired accuracy. &nbsp;Recall that $$a_3$$ is the $$x^7$$ term.Now all that's left is to show that&nbsp;&nbsp;$$a_{n+1}&lt;\frac{a_n}{100}$$ for $$n\geq3$$. &nbsp;That's easy to see by taking the ratio of terms:\[\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}= \frac{2n+1}{2n+2}{1 \over 100}\frac{2n+1}{2n+3}\]Evaluating at $$n=3$$ (the $$x^7$$ term), we get\[{a_4 \over a_3}=\frac{7}{8} \frac{7}{9} 10^{-2}={49 \over 72}10^{-2}&lt;10^{-2}\].Note that the ratio is not $$&lt;10^{-3}$$ as asserted in the lecture.",3
