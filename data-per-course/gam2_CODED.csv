5640,1392757126,"Someone on another thread recommended the language learning site busuu.com a few weeks ago. I gave it a try and didn't enjoy it at all. First off was the cookie-cutter problem. I used to use Livemocha a few years ago and this was very similar. I'd spent a lot of time on that site helping people with their English and had worked my way up to some kind of gold star level, which didn't turn out to mean much. I eventually gave it up because of the huge time and effort it took, and now busuu was asking me to do the same thing all over. It just seemed like a lot of work and not a lot of fun.For the lessons I tried, I was being rewarded with berries for doing things correctly--even very simple things, even things that I was just guessing at. It just didn't seem at all meaningful.And as for the social aspect of friending strangers who speak my target language to get my assignments marked, I just really don't like friending strangers. It didn't appeal to me with LiveMocha, and it still doesn't appeal at busuu.On the other hand, I've been using Duolingo for a few months now and am quite enjoying that. The social demands are way less. I can comment on some translation or help people or not as I choose, but I don't have to spend time on that if I don't want to. Basically it is just less like work but with enough gamelike feedback to make me want to learn new material and review the old.

2805,1391486149,"Hey, I am [REDACTED] from [REDACTED]. 
This is very nice topic he mentioned. I hope to contribute something meaningful to you all.
Old: I used to play Knight Online, Prince of Persia 1-2-3 (favoritely 2&gt;1&gt;3 - i don&#39;t want to mention 4,5 which were totally disappoint for me), Green Army and Fifa 2005. Knight online was for group play with my friends, Prince of Persia ... with its narrative and puzzles I loved it, Army Men... with its legendary Sarge and colorful soldiers and environment took me whole-heartedly to its joy. I played Fifa 2005 mostly to spend time with friends, now i hate Football.
New: Over the more than haf decade the new full-blown games like Assasins&#39;s Creed, Call of Duty, Crysis, Far Cry, Dishonored have been totally AMAZING. I developed a new attitude towards a game in which to be stealth as much as possible. Dishonored for example Dishonored is my favourite because you don&#39;t have to kill EVERYONE, Far Cry with its story taking a one big gap, but the gameplay very enthusically remarkable. Call of Duty series, exceptionally some of them (you know what i mean) were a great research to me. Each time I developed a idea of purpose from episodes and tactics to develop simultaneously. Ohh last but not least Assasins&#39;s Creed -- from Altair, to Ezio, to Connor, to Edward.. Those conspiracies and battles taught a lot to me about Rome History and the stealthy feeling never stopped with its vivid features. 
I love games, and my path(teaching) taking a shape and I want to learn from it.

Gamification can be used here and the ideas are very good.You should also use the fidelty card here, as it is already in use: If you buy something online instead of offline you get rewarded twice as many points for example. Perhaps also bonus points for registering, first purchase online, buying many different products (""You already tried out 5% of our product range"") or other tasks as mentioned above.You could also add rewards for buying a lot of vegetables or getting all the ingredients for a certain meal, so you can earn badges and bonus points for cooking healthy/traditional/etc. meals. This can also be a way of getting people to come back ""I want to know which new recipe is posted today/this week.""There should also be a reward for registering until a certain date, so many people join in a short time and the social aspect can be used from the beginning. Like showing what you bought to your friends or sharing recipes with friends and making it easy to put the required ingredients on their shopping list...You should not use tasks, that stop the people from buying or doing certain things like ""badge for not buying unhealthy food"" or ""bonus for shopping only online and not offline"", because then the people would just go to a different store for these things.Ok, just some brainstorming, but perhaps it helps",2

For me, it's primarily a means to interact socially with people in a way other than having an engaged conversation with them. (When stuck at the cottage, it's somewhere between reading a book (cutting myself off from people around me) and a committed-to conversation or debate (complete social engagement).Yahtzee offers social fun, for sure. But I'm not sure if it qualifies as 'easy fun' or 'hard fun'. It's a little complicated the first time, but if you think of it as 'poker with scaffolding' it offers relatively easy fun for adults, slightly harder fun for kids, and everyone can move to a higher level of mastery over time. Your choices are limited and nicely categorized, but choices made earlier in the game start to constrain your options towards the end of the game. There are surprises, but if you start to appreciate the probability of certain roles, you can make wise bets that pay off over time.It's also a good example of balance - all those combos mean that you'll often role 'something' each time - but allows for lucky streaks to pull ahead unexpectedly, or get you out of looming disaster.

I think it could be fine short term for a startup as long as the habits that were being formed were the right habits and don't rely on the game elements.I can empathise with her stand point, though. I am a website developer and I see many advertisments for web hosting companies that offer easy to build websites. I have looked at the end results of these web-builders and quite often cringe at what s being produced. I would say that a badly implemented game system could be similar.I don't feel threatened or concerned by these web-builders as I see the benefit I can gain from them. When the people that are using them realise the end result is not working, they will start looking for professional help to build a website that works.Applying Gamification badly, however is different. If a website is bad it is the business that is effected as the customers won't be directed through to the sales channels properly, it is acting like a locked door to a shop, customers just won't come. If they do come back and things are fixed then there is no real long term damage. Bad gamification could be worse than the locked door, however, it could be more like a member of the sales team telling everyone to F off and shop somewhere else. Even if it is fixed, customers might not come back because they have been driven away from the business by the poor experience.I do think gamifying motivation is powerful and that is why I think it needs to be taken very seriously and implemented properly.",2

I think the idea of gamifying personal fitness goals can be great, but we walk a fine line when that personal fitness goal is weight loss and you are comparing yourself to others (that's what the team members inadvertently encouraged when they very loudly expressed pleasure or disdain over weight loss) rather than measuring your own achievement toward your own goal.

I thought if I had to spend time looking for hidden messages within the lecture videos I would miss some of the content being presented...so I decided not to look.I wonder if anyone else thought the same way?Until this course I had never played Plants v Zombies ... now I have become addicted to it.I think it was introduced to show us the concepts of onboarding and scaffolding but I kept playing it as I moved throough the course and was pleased to identify more and more game elements and structures it uses as my knowledge about the subject increased.I discovered that I am absolutely useless at folding proteins, so when it comes to solving puzzles for science I am not much use. I might give this another go when I have some spare time...perhaps.I enjoyed interacting with people on the discussion forums...although I think some people, perhaps, could have done a little more to find the fun in this course. Does it really matter so desperately if your peers graded you two marks rather than three in an assignment?And I have now completed a course which I will find useful in my job - I do work for a company which uses gamification in its business so this course was really helpful.Finally this was my first introduction to the concept of a Massive Open Online Course...and I don't think I could have had a better introduction.Ok time for me to go, I have either got some zombies to kill or some proteins to fold...one or the other.And if you still have the final exam to complete...good luck.[REDACTED].",3

4323,1392065209,"[REDACTED], parents have always ""gamified"" the kids chores and behaviour, I think. How many of us had a little chart where you drew a happy face or sad face depending on whether you made your bed and ate your veggies that day? ;) I did and it actually worked to make me and my brother behave better. I wouldn't call it manipulation, I think we've gotten so scared of that word that every action that's intended to change someone's behaviour is seen as somehow suspect and shady now. And it shouldn't be, because influencing (a much better word, I think) other people to do things is a perfectly normal and necessary part of everyday life, unless you're a hermit. Especially when we are talking about people with little to no impulse control and sense of self-preservation, also known as little kids. ;)And about gamifying work - I think it can be ethically problematic only when you try to sneak it in unnoticed, like it's something shameful that should be avoided, probably hiding the real value of the work people are doing to justify not paying them much money. I've participated in several astronomy programs that asked people around the world to help them analyze the tons of data they had and they were usually gamified to some extent. It felt like a puzzle game and it was definitely fun, and I don't really understand the mindset of someone who'd be okay with doing that only so long as no one said ""by the way, you're doing some very important work right now"". I think the same would apply to actual ""work work"" - if I got a job and they told me ""we want you to search the huge database for errors, but we've designed it to look like a pattern recognition puzzle game so you wouldn't get bored to death after 3 days"" I would definitely not complain about that...",2

7580,1393851532,"I got 10 for this assignment, but I think I was a bit lucky because brand development is my specialty. I hope this helps, and any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.**********This report will show reasons why utilization of gamification can 
enhance competitiveness of Cereals Inc.?â‚¬?s marketing objectives.First
 of all, studies indicate that playing games can alter the participants'
 behaviors to be as intended by the game designers or organizers. This 
concept is called Behavior Change Games,
 and it's been a growing trend recently in training industry. Therefore,
 if we can tap into this concept, we will gain higher opportunity in 
altering the target's behavior to match our business objectives.In terms of business application, several studies
 show that our target audience - Generation X-ers and Y-ers - are 
already well-versed with video games, social media, internet, and 
general information technology. This means that the application of 
gamification to our marketing strategy is not a far-fetched foreign 
concept that needs hefty amount of time for our target to get accustomed
 to. On contrary, as the majority of our target grows up playing video 
games, they have a tendency to implement gaming concept to most aspects their lives - which also includes motivation and decision-making process to buy.Branding-wise,
 gamification can help creating stronger impact on brand recognition as 
gamified advertising campaigns usually stand out better than traditional
 ones. Should the target interacts with our gamified campaign, our brand
 will further benefit from higher brand retention as well.In 
addition to science and reasons above, elements of fun in gamification 
can enliven our marketing strategy to touch the target on emotional 
level. It is commonly known in advertising industry that ideas which 
touch the audience?â‚¬?s heart have stronger persuasiveness than rational 
appeals. By all means, you can't bore customers to buy your product.Conclusively,
 application of gamification can help us achieve many business goals 
including, but not limited to, consumer's behavior alteration, greater 
effectiveness in communication and branding, just to name a couple.",1

9576,1395665602,"Hello ^_^YI've been curious about this thread for a while now, and that super detailed post with the graphs and figures up above was extremely informative! Thanks heaps for all your efforts:) ??As for the quote claiming that students learned better in MOOCs when they interacted with others-I completely agree. For me, if I'm not engaging in some meticulous discussion eg like this one, or arguments about motivation, then it's harder to feel connected to everything. This is especially true of online learning I think since you don't technically see your classmates/professors in person. And this might not make sense, but what I really enjoy about MOOCs is the ability to be heard. What I mean by that is sometimes in classrooms, there are more quiet students who don't often voice their opinion. In an online platform like coursera, that divide doesn't really exist anymore. Written communication is very different from verbal communication, and sometimes things you might not be able to phrase out loud just come out better in an affinity space like this. Getting feedback in response to a post feels very rewarding. Analysing/discussing/debating something with other students feels extremely rewarding. Going through an entire course with the same people and reaching the end together, is the biggest reward of them all. That's what it is about participation. I think it's not only the more you participate, the more you learn. But it's also, the more positive you feel-because you made a difference by choosing to be part of a team.Anyway, the stats:) The fact that there is a slight decrease in enrollments from 2012 to 2013 may be due to the simple fact of novelty. I don't know if 2012 was the first year gamification was offered, but I'd imagine that any new MOOC would instantly grab people's attention-curiosity, never heard of xyz before and so on. And from then on, I'd guess the rates of participation would fluctuate from year to year, depending on the popularity of the course/its relevance to other fields like education, business, medicine etc.Great insights!!:D",2

Think like a game designer

Challenges involved in creating a game.

??

There are five relevant words:

?â‚¬?I am a game designer.?â‚¬?

It reminds us that game design is a state of mind.?? If you goal is to have more people
visit your website, or to pick the best employee, or whatever it is, think
about that as a game.?? 

If the participants were playing and if you were designing
what would you do?

However, you do not need to become a game designer to employ
gamification.?? You do not need to
have the skills that the game designer have.?? 

It is also different from thinking like a gamer.?? If you were playing a game, you were probably
not thinking about the structure of the game. 

??

??

Thinking about players.?? 

Whoever it is, you need to say , ?â‚¬?They are my player.?â‚¬?
Instead of customer or consumer.?? 

In game design, the relationship is designer and
player.?? The players are the center
of the game.?? Even though the game
is built by a company the world evolves around the player.?? Players need to feel that they are in
control.?? Players need to feel
autonomy.?? 

??

Something that players care about

Players play.??
Play is a sense of free motion.??
It does not have to have goal.??


Game designers need to 

1)????
Get the players into game

2)????
Make the players continue playing

How do you make people in??? Once they are in, how do I keep them there?????",1
